Dialogue
"It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!"
There you go! Someone came!
"Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!"
"Hi, glad you could come."
"Please, come in."
"Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class."
"Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."
"Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's..."
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps.
Who is he?
"Some guy, Tom Gordon."
"I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives."
"So, did you know Ross well?"
"Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?"
"Yes, he is. Me."
What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
"Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!"
"Hey, listen. Call me."
Ok!
"So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?"
"Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someone."
"Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?"
"Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with."
You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Yeah...
... And you called him Alby!? I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
"Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man."
"Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!"
"Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues..."
"Oh! like what?! Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""Access Hollywood""."
"Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him."
Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
A guy who won two.
Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
Yeah... for three years.
Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
"Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?"
"No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant."
Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?
Hi!
Hi!
"So umm, what's this book about?"
You didn't read this one either?!
"Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else."
What?
"Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman."
No! You should've read it yourself!
Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!
"Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg."
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
"Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time."
"Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?"
"Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights."
"Well, go ahead Rachel."
"Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time."
"If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right."
"Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots."
Hi.
Hi.
"I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!"
Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
"Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... Only... only not creepy."
"Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?"
"I uhm... Well, I sang... well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back..."
You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
"But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles."
owwwww...
Please don't take her away from me!
"'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'"
We?
"Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay."
"Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry."
"Ross, my father doesn't hate you."
"Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'."
"But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do."
Hey Pheebs.
Hey!
Any sign of your brother?
"No, but he's always late."
I thought you only met him once?
"Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'"
"Well relax, he'll be here."
Monica.
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Monica bang!
"Okay, I heard that."
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
Uh-huh.
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Monica bang!
"Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?"
"Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now."
You okay?
"Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it."
Oh hey! Wait up!
Hi!
Congratulations! I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey because I didn't know if he knew yet.
"What, that we had a baby? Come on let's give him a little credit, although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier."
"No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!"
What?
"Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time."
"Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose."
Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
I am a doctor! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
"All right, me too. Should we wake her up?"
"No! No, come on let her sleep! She's so exhausted."
"Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this."
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Over here dad.
"Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is."
"Oh, you look so great."
"Ahh, so do you, beautiful."
Oops.
What?
"Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you."
"Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress."
Everybody smile.
"Oh, dad, turn it off."
It is off.
"Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?"
It's the off light. Right Ross?
You look pretty tonight.
"Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?"
"Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music."
"Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . ."
"Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . ."
"Oh, the guys are here."
this summer?
"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... ""gay as the day is long""?"
Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
"Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge."
"Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go."
What are you doing?
"Oh, you'll see my friend."
I'll just wait to put your order in.
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
I'm so sorry ...
"We got locked out of the apartment, we ..."
That's a great story. Can I eat it?
And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
"It wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do."
And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
"Oh honey, this is for the best, this way I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!"
What?
"She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you."
Thanks. Oh.
"Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop."
You guys ever heard the story about when Ross's mom went to the beauty salon?
You mean the willie story?
"Huh-huh, they already know it!"
"You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order."
"No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want."
Why would you do that?
"Chandler, control your woman!"
"Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock."
Aw ... what?
"No, no, Emma dropped her sock."
"Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town."
"Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground."
It's a good toast.
Could you please get her attention?
Mommy!
Hi!
Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
"Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated."
Oh my God!
What?!
What?!
Monday?!
How long do you have to go for?
They said it could be up to a year.
A year?!
Do you have to go?
I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing.
"There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?"
"Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week."
"I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it."
We were gonna go see the Jets!
"You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!"
Really?
Not you.
I can't believe you guys are moving.
I call their apartment!!!
No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!!
I don't know what else to say.
"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
"I feel terrible, I really do."
"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
"Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?"
Yes.
It's that terrible?
"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you."
"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
I love you too.
"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that."
"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
"I'd do anything for you, you know that."
I'd do anything for you.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait!"
Hey buddy.
"Uh, hi."
"Um, can I come back in?"
Why?
"I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about."
But you left.
"Hi, it's me."
"Oh, my, god."
Janice? You called Janice?
"Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?"
"You remember Janice, right?"
"Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody."
Helloo!!
"Oh, my, god!"
"Geez, look how fat she got."
"Hey, it's everybody."
"Janice, you're--"
"Yes, I am."
Is it--?
"Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now."
Congratulations.
"Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry."
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
"Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!"
Frankie? What're you talking about?
"Hey, what's goin' on?"
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
What?
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
"Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend."
"That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say."
"This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story."
Where's Buddy?
Buddy?
"My fish, Buddy."
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
"Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my intelligence by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?"
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
"Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period."
Isn’t the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
"Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here,  Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave ‘Hi’ to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on."
"Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge."
"No. No, thank you!"
"Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!"
I have sex with dinosaurs??
I believe I read that somewhere!
"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!"
I respectfully disagree.
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Who cares? Nobody reads those things
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
I don't have a page.
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
Good morning!
"Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished."
What?
I was giving you an apology and you were totally checking her out!
"I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area."
"Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep."
Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
"Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass"". Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate."
I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
"That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deep meaningful relationship."
Huh. What's Tag's last name?
"It was ... oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just ""Tag"". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses."
But it was a deep meaningful relationship.
"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!"
It was Jones.
"Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?"
You want me to see a therapist?
"Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father."
"Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing."
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
"Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff."
"Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor."
"This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?"
"Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed."
"Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July."
Because it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
"It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset because nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just..."
"I, I know."
"Okay, you come up with an idea."
"Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out."
But we love our house.
"Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and ""Oh My God""!"
"Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of surprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body."
"Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too."
"Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it."
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
"All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor."
Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
"Oh, me too..."
Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Huh?
I never stopped loving you.
Oh... my...
"Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein."
"Chandler, what are you talking about?"
"Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing."
"I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us."
Obviously.
"But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now."
Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
"Chandler, one of us has got to be strong."
I understand.
"Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... Goodbye Chandler Bing."
They're never coming down now.
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
I kissed Kathy.
What?
Are you serious?
Does Joey know?
"No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?"
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
"No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside."
"Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?"
"I think maybe, yeah."
He loves you.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
"Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe."
"Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea."
"I know, I remember that!"
I remember you did.
God!! What am I gonna do?!
"Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him."
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Because you do.
"Yeah, I know."
"Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this."
"All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?"
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
"No, the quiet down thing!"
You mean this.
"Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?"
"All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!"
"All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game."
Okay.
Hey guys! Hey!
"Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today."
"Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson."
Nope.
Morly Safer.
Nope.
The woman who cuts my hair!
"Okay, look, this could be a really long game."
Your sister Ursula.
"Oh, really."
"Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh..."
"Rift’s. Yeah, I know."
"Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years."
"Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?"
Not from where I was standin’.
where were you standing?
"Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don’t get along?"
"It’s mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like ""yeah, right, well what else is new?"""
Hi!
Hi.
"Oh, I’m so glad you called. I feel like it’s always me calling you. So, what’s up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?"
"It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy."
It’s because I’m with you.
Aw. I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…
"Whoops. Sorry. This just in. Oh, it’s 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away."
Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.
"Awww, I’ll miss you too Pheebs. And I will be holding you, right here."
Hey guys.
Hey.
What's in the bag?
"Um, just some presents."
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
"OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh."
Cute.
"I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom."
"Ross, that is gorgeous!"
Yeah?
"Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy."
Ross.
Yeah?
Can I ask you something?
Uh-huh.
When Carol was pregnant with Ben…
Mmm?
…were you this irritating?
Wow!
Excuse me?!
"Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you."
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
"Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then."
"Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’s great!"
Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!
"Hey, Lizzie."
"Hey, Weird Girl."
I brought you alphabet soup.
Did you pick out the vowels?
"Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, I also have something else for you."
Saltines?
"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?"
"What? Oh my God, there's really money in here."
I know.
"Weird Girl, what are you doing?"
"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it."
"No, no, I ha-I have to give you something."
"Oh, that's fine, no."
Would you like my tin-foil hat?
"No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks."
"Please, let me do something."
"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?"
Okay.
Okay.
"Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy... Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... All right sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody... I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh!  I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo..."
Hey!
"Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that..."
"Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?"
"Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider..."
You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
"Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute."
Wow! What a pleasure.
"Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written."
Excuse me. Hi.
Yes?
"Well, your kind of sitting in my seat."
"What do you mean, your seat?"
"I mean, I was sitting there."
"But, you got up!"
"But, I never left the room!"
"But, you left the chair area."
"All right, that's it, give me your underwear."
Hey.
Hey.
"Is ah, is Chandler around?"
"No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house."
Oooh.
"Yeah, Ginger something."
"Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?"
"No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, ‘the movie star.’"
"Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did."
"Well, what did you do?"
"What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that, it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life."
"Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it’ll be more fun that way."
"All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner...."
You gave her food poisoning!?
"I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log."
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
"I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg."
"Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?"
I ran!!
"Oh hey Ross, oh I'm so glad someone's here. Could you zip me up?"
Sure.
Thank you. Can you believe no one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?.
People. So why you all dressed up?
Oh umm. Mike's picking me up for a date.
"Oh yea? Now um, how is that going, is it getting serious?"
"Oh I dunno, I dunno, you know I mean, I like him but am I ready to take my grade-A loins off the meat market?"
"You know, I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy. I'm always like, is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?"
"Yeah, you know, you are a bit of a drama queen."
"But you, you're so much better off. You just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terms into anything serious."
"I wouldn't say never, you know. There's that guy ... well what about...OK well there's gotta be someone."
There isn't. That's what I'm saying.
"Oh my God, you're right!"
"I know, and yet here you are, all ready for the next date."
I can't believe I never realized this before. I'm in my 30s and never been in a long-term relationship! Oh my God! What's wrong with me?
"No, no, no there's nothing wrong with you. I mean, you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway."
I wanna get married!
"Please don't cry because of me, Pheebs. I don't know what I'm talking about. I've been divorced three times!"
At least you've been married! Oh my God! I wanna trade lives with Ross!
"Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married."
"I know, they’re gonna be so happy together."
"Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?"
Not that often!
No! I’m so happy for them!
Me too! So happy for them!
I’m so happy and not at all jealous.
"Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!"
"I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing."
Totally. I’m like 90/10.
Yeah me too.
"Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn’t know better I’d say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let’s get some tea."
Okay.
"Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I don’t want you to use your housekeeper ‘cause it would just split her focus."
"Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don’t even have a housekeeper."
"It’s like you’re a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don’t know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay."
"Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca."
Such a sweet woman.
"Well, however great she was I just can’t afford that."
Oh Rachel!
What?
I just had the greatest idea! I’m gonna come live with you!
Wh-wh-what? What?
"Oh, I’m so happy I’m gonna do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes."
Yes. Yes I do.
I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!
"Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?"
"Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy."
"You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!"
"And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh, open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you."
You got another ex-wife back there?
Please start drinking!
I’m just going to grab the phone.
"Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but, but, um… what are you doing?"
"Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?"
"No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don’t you go back to your place and give us some privacy?"
"But, but, Mona, I live here."
Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something to remember me by.
Hi.
Hi.
Guess what?
What?
They published my paper.
"Oh, really, let me see, let me see."
"Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is."
Hey hey hey! She's on!
Ah! Nora Bing!
...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
Your mom was arrested?
"Shhh, busy beaming with pride."
"...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man..."
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Shhh.
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
"Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?"
"Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love..."
Awww!
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
You’ve never asked a guy out?!!
No. Have you?
Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?
I don’t even know how I would go about it.
"Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin’?"""
"Oh, please!"
"Hey, how you doin’?"
"You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin’? Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we—the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye. You’ve done that a thousand times?"
I’ve never done that.
"Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no."
"Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!"
Really?! You think that will work?
"Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?"
"Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen."
Really?
Will you call him?
"Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad. Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?"
"Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?"
That’s me.
"Ahh, yes."
"Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000."
You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.
Okay. Okay.
I was actually relieved uh I didn’t win the boat. My wife would’ve killed me.
Ohh…
Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?
It’s Pam.
"Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, ""The Pam."""
Aw-awww!
I don’t think she’d like that.
"Okay, uh-uh imagine this, ""The Mr. Bowmont."""
Oooooh…
I don’t think so dear.
"Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in your h——arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You can—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you’re old, Cappy."
"What the hell, it’s for a good cause! All right!"
No way! It’s mine!!
What?! What?!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
"But Joey you don’t have $20,000!"
"Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!"
"Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now"
"Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?"
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Sure. So how long you been...
"Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?"
Since then?!
"No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?"
...I d'know.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
You're one to talk.
"Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women."
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
"Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Professor Geller?
Yeah?
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Oh thank you. Thanks very much.
"Uh, I’m a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation…"
That was you?
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You’re a teacher. I’m a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
"Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea."
"Oh, because I was thinking, the semester’s over; you’re not my teacher anymore."
What time?
"Oh, y’know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A."
Gotcha.
I’m kidding!
"Oh! So-so seriously, what time?"
"Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower."
That's pretty much it.
Oops!
"But you tell it really well, sweetie."
"Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you."
Okay. I'll miss you.
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Chandler M. Bing?
Yeah-ha!
Oh my God.
I’m sorry about your date.
Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.
"Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea."
Thanks sweetie.
"You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?"
"Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars."
"Hey, I thought I cheered you up."
"Oh you did, there are twenty in here."
Right. Good night.
Good night.
"Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!"
"Ooh, your brother. Score!"
What’s up?
"Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi."
"Oh, put him on!"
"Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later."
"Hello? Hey Mon, how’s the packing going? Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right—Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack."
"Hey, Pheebs!"
Hey.
"Hey, how’s it going?"
"Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here. Crazy!"
Here you go sweetie.
"What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!"
"But, I put some honey in it."
"She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?"
"No, the doctors say it may kill her."
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
But I think we should tell her.
"Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job."
"Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!"
"Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31."
"I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?"
"Well, you used to like playing the guitar."
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
"Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack."
"Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!"
Hi!
Hey.
Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
They’re mine!
"Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them."
Return them?! Shh! They’re gonna hear you!
"Honey, I’m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I’m going to wear them all the time. You’ll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?"
I have you.
Nice try; I’m keeping the boots.
"Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium."
Dysprosium.
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
"And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues."
"Y’know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us."
Well Rachel needs help with the baby.
I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.
I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.
Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
"No, not a thing."
It’s frightening.
"Well uh, y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself."
That’s true. You do have another child.
Yeah.
With another woman. Have you no control Ross?
"That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things."
Well then you really don’t need me to live with you.
"Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed."
You’re gonna be a great father.
Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma.
"You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?"
"I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?"
It’s just hard when I know I have e-mail I can’t get!
Hi!
Monica! Hi honey.
"All right, on the table."
"Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you."
"Oh, believe me, I don’t want to get hurt either. I’m being smart about this. See these guys? They’re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter."
Promise me you’ll be careful.
I promise.
Happy Thanksgiving!
You too!
Anything I can do to help?
"Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’s really into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?"
Sure!
I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Okay.
"No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?"
"Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So how’s the game?"
I have no idea.
What?
Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.
I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Is your team winning hon?
Yeah! Anderson just scored again! There’s no Anderson.
"Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all, I didn’t realize this game was on."
"Oh, I didn’t know you liked football."
"Well normally I don’t, but y’know……Green Bay is playing."
You like Green Bay?
Well it’s only like my favorite bay!
D’oh!! I’ve got it!
You don’t have it.
"I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know."
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
"Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy."
Go on.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.
And Milton Berle has a…
"Ohh, not compared to you."
"Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?"
"I feel great. I feel- great, I feel great."
"Wow, those pills really worked, huh?"
"Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister, I love Pheebs..."
Ooh! That's so nice...
...Chandler!
Hey.
"And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me."
You were right.
Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
"Oh, well you know who I love the most?"
No.
You!
Oh.. you don't get it!
"Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I can’t, I can’t watch."
"okay, Pheebs, they’re gone."
Okay.
Are you alright?
"Yeah. It’s just, you know, it’s this whole stupid Ursula thing, it’s..."
"Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he’s going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?"
"Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I’m not saying she’s like evil or anything. She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?"
No.
"Well, but that’s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn’t even talk to me any more. Because he said he didn’t wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us."
"Oh... Oh, Pheebs."
"I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but..."
You’re not gonna lose him.
"Hon, you gotta talk to Joey."
Yeah. Okay.
"No, come on, he doesn’t know this stuff. If he knew how you felt."
But he’s falling in love with her.
"Oh please, they’ve been going out a week. They haven’t even slept together yet, I mean, that’s not serious."
Okay... Okay.
"Oh, okay, oh."
"OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?"
"OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat. Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?"
They're your backup singers... behind you.
"OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know."
Alrighty. From the top.
"OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat actually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat."
"Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here."
"Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go."
"Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?"
"Honey, what's the matter?"
I just saw Janice.
Oh.
"Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them."
"Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me."
"Oh, look at her, so happy!"
If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
"Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?"
"No, he's picking up dinner, why, what's up?"
"Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you."
All right...
We think Chandler might be having an affair.
What?
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
They went in together. So sorry.
Oh my God! Oh my God that's awful! What did you think of the house?
What?
"Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?"
"Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?"
"Mmm. Oh, no-"
Sorry-
"No no no, go-"
"No, you have it, really, I don't want it-"
Split it?
Okay.
"Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
I knew.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I did.
"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?"
"Yeah, maybe..."
"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Hi!
Hey! Hiya!
"Hey! Hey, cute jacket!"
"Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!"
Oh! Ow!
"Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!"
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
"Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!"
"Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!"
You're so sweet!
"Ohh, you're so sweet!"
"Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me."
Huh.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Uhh….
"You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?"
Nah.
Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal suite.
"That’s right. I’m no longer a bride. I’ll never be a bride again. Now, I’m just someone’s wife!"
"And I’m the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!"
"Oh yeah, right."
We got the honeymoon.
That’s not ‘til Thursday.
The wedding pictures?
They won’t be ready for weeks.
Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
That’s true!I knew I married you for a reason!
"I’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home."
Okay.
"Dude, are you okay?"
Totally.
"Ross, you don't seem okay."
"I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan."
"Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off."
No!
"I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely."
Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
"You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?"
Okay.
Alright.
"God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so.."
"Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me."
Bye.
"Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!"
"You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too."
"Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone."
"No, no, it's just that it's getting late..."
"Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good."
I don't even know what that's for.
You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
"Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
"Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this."
"It doesn't look good, does it?"
"Huh—Wait so Joey if you get this, you’re gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac—Hey! You love those!"
"Well, don’t get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen."
"Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?"
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if I’m good enough.
I am.
"Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor."
You really think so?
"Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!"
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
"I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think."
"Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?"
"You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad."
"I promise you, he would definitely want you back."
"I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back."
"But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together."
"Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated."
"Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too."
But...
"No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... roommates anymore."
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
"Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face."
What?
Why?
"The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep."
"Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?"
"No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, ""I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!"" and he let her right in."
So you hit her in the face?
"No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me."
"Aww, Pheebs."
"Honey, that’s you’re name."
That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
"Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later."
"Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?"
"Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday."
"Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?"
No.
"Well, here it is."
"OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady..."
"Oh, isn't Lori a doll?"
"Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in."
"Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later.  Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her."
"Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound."
"It's, uh, it's Paul."
"Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!"
Who's Paul?
"Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
Maybe.
Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
He finally asked you out?
Yes!
Hello?
"Hey, were the hell have you been?!"
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
I don’t want to hear about her!!
"Ahh Pheebs, you know you’re still my number one girl."
"No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel’s coming to London."
Ohh great!!!
"No it’s not great. No, she’s coming to tell Ross that she loves him."
"But, he loves Emily?"
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She’s going to ruin the wedding!!
Okay.
"All right, so, okay..."
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
"Okay, so I’m done my part, okay. It’s your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?"
Right!
So tell me about this girl?
Hello?
"Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!"
"Hey, Raych!"
This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends."
I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."
He's not stoned.
Did he go out for a cigarette?
"Yeah, four times."
"My dear, sweet Raych."
"Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three."
"Well... I like how you look, what are you?"
Puerto Rican.
"Two, I think a two."
"You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?"
"Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat."
"Wow, you catch on quick."
"Well, I have a PhD, so..."
"One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!"
You sprayed my front twice!
You've never turned?
"No, I barely even got to three Mississippi."
Mississippi? I said count to five'!
"Mississippilesly? Well, how bad is it?"
"Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours."
"So, how dark is it gonna get?"
You got sprayed with two two' s and...
I'm a four?
"Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out."
Really!
You might wanna get back in there.
Ok!
"Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? Ah, oh, ah! Ah! The same thing happened again!"
You got two more twos?
I'm an eight!
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
Ross! Wait!
"Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about…"
You suck!!
What?!
"Okay, break-up’s still on!"
Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
"Oh no, I can’t go. I’m practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show."
Oh cool!
That’s great.
"Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I’ll Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I’ll be Joey Trrrribbiani!"
You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!
But the audition’s in a couple hours and I don’t even understand the game.
Well do you want some help?
Oh really? That’d be great! You guys can be the contestants!
Awesome!
"Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time."
All right! Let’s play Bamboozled!
Bamboozled?
"Yeah, isn’t that a cool name?"
Yeah!
No!
"All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don’t you tell us a little something about you Ross?"
"Well uh, I-I’m a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! And uh…"
"I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?"
"Well Joey, I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!"
"Excellent! Let’s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you’ll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?"
Bogota.
"It’s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card."
What does a Wicked Wango card do?
"I should know that. Let’s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower."
Higher or lower than what?
This is embarrassing.
Can you believe how lame this is?
"I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other."
"Morning, roomy!"
Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Fifth day's a charm.
"Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma."
"Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?"
"Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Raych, when will we expect to see you tonight?"
"Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so..."
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
Bye!
"Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles."
You’re doing it again.
"We’re not doing anything. We’re just sitting around talking, quietly."
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can’t sleep.
You don’t even have cats.
I could have cats.
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
We’ll try to keep it down.
"Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch."
So apparently I’m available for lunch.
I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.
You’re moving?
"Yeah, I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want my child’s first words to be, ""How you doin’?"""
So does-does Joey know you’re moving?
"Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book."
That’s not really porn.
Not so much.
"Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died."
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
"Well I don’t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. With your permission."
Yeah that would really be great.
Yeah.
Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
Yeah. No. No you’re right.
Shall we?
Yeah.
"Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat."
"Okay, so umm, what’s your friend’s name?"
"Oh, Chandler."
Hi Chandler!
That’s… That’s was…
Oh my God!
That’s Fergie baby!!
"Joey says you don’t really like his hat, but I think it’s kinda dashing."
How did you? How? How?
"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and…Hey!"
"...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray...."
"Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there."
What if you put them here.
"Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too."
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
"Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry."
It's all right. Sweetheart.
There he is!
There's our star!
"So, so, what'd ya think?"
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
I-I wasn't in that.
I know.
"Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate."
Hi!
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
So that's the girl you like.
Yeah.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
That's right my friend. It's time for...
Baywatch!!
"Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?"
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
"Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe."
"Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?"
"Hey, hey, they're runnin'"
"See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind."
"Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!"
"I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed."
"Wow, you worked in a mine?"
"I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?"
"God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that."
"Oh, this is not that bad."
"Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job."
"You can totally, totally live on this."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Oh, by the way, great service tonight."
Oh! Yeah!
Pete's breaking up with me.
What?!
"I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk."
And?
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
"Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you."
Really?!
"Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you."
Ooh Monica!
Hi!
"Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him."
I…I have to fire him.
But why?!
"Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!"
"Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two."
"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished."
"But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?"
"All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!"
"That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too."
I paid to have this done.
Love it!
"Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula."
"Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here."
"What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?"
Our apartment is ready.
And that makes you angry because…
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Where did you get that?
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Phoebe?
Hm?
"Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!"
Fish!
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal."
"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here…"
"Oh, it's so much more fun with you."
"We did have fun, didn't we?"
We did!
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight."
"Oh, I would love to!"
"Yay, okay!"
"What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well."
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
"Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar..."
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing! It's an expression.
No it's not.
"Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles..."
"Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer."
"...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem."
"Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?"
Sure! Oh...
You're not sick!
"What? Yes, I am!"
"Ok, then, why are you... all dressed up??"
"When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!"
You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
"Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!"
"Ok, what is this?"
Ok! Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
WHAT?
Wh-what's going on?
Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
I thought you came to say you were sick.
Ok professor or detective?
Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
"Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!"
And that horrible museum tour!
"No, I arranged that..."
"What, what's that?"
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
"Open it, open in."
Oh my God.
Woah.
"Look at this, how did I spend so much money?"
"Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due."
Ahh.
"What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?"
"My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do."
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
What?
That audition.
That's a two line part.
"Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite."
So what.
"So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money."
"Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic."
Toilet paper?
Yeah.
"Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic."
"Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend."
I am your friend.
"Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'"
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
"Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe."
Food here at 'Javu'.. will kill you.. the food here at 'Javu' ... will kill you..
"Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall."
"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
"Ok, you have to stop playing now."
Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
"Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!"
Get your garlic-peelers off me!
"Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller.. I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?"
"Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!"
"Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant?"
"Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?"
Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
"Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking?"
Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?
Oh... Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry too...
ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...
Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
"Sorry, looks like it's just him."
"Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!"
"Well, I... I am having a good hair day."
So good to see you.
Me too.
I'm ok.
I'm sorry... Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
"It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field."
"Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!"
Shall we?
Thank you! I can't believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?
"Oh my God, I completely forgot! Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place!"
You weren't there!
"No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm."
"Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?"
"So, tell me about it."
"Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert."
M-m.
"See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated."
Break up with Charlie!
What?
What?
"Did you just say ""break up with Charlie""?"
"Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it."
"Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?"
"I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her."
Are you serious?
"If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!"
No!
Joking it is!
"..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference."
"Okay, errrr, Monica?"
"Yes? ..yes, she is."
"Hi, this is my friend Rachel."
Hi.
"Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell."
"And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen."
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Excuse me?
"I meant er,  young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach."
Thank you.
Right.
"Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven."
"Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!"
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
What is it?
"Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!"
Barry who you almost...?
Barry who I almost.
"And Mindy, your maid of...?"
"Mindy, my maid of. Oh!"
"That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you."
"Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?"
No.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
No that made me feel precious.
"Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!"
Yeah? Sometimes it's…
"Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose."
"Okay, I'm the baby."
Eh! Stop it!
Hey!
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Hey!
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Why?!
"I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast."
That game should not be played without my supervision.
"Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge."
What's in the bag?
"Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?"
I do!
Hey!
Hey.
What’s up?!
"Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know."
"Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it."
"No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them."
What?!
"Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there."
With Ross and Jill?
Yeah!
With Ross and my sister?
Yeah.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Yeah.
Oh there is no way.
Okay then.
"Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me."
"But great news about the apartment pants, huh?"
What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
Hi!
I’m so glad you could make it.
"Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it."
Try. There’s my little girl.
She’s still mad.
Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
"Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?"
"No look, we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it."
Okay. I can do that. I gotta go powder my ass.
So we should probably get going soon.
"Oh, but the party’s only just getting started!"
"Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner."
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
"No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, ""Surprise!"" And then, ""Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye!"""
"But Ross, I’m such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties."
Monica said that did she?
Lucky sixes....
"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica."
Hi!
And Joey....
Hi!
And Ross.
Hi!
something in Italian
He doesn't speak much English.
Monopoly!
Look at that!
"So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
"Oh... Italy, I think."
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!"
"That, that is funny....... and Rachel keeps touching him."
"Hey, he's not crying."
Yes! There's still pie.
"I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?"
"Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today."
"Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?"
"You, you are gonna love this."
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
"Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!"
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I’m gonna kill you!!
Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.
So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!
You got Rachel pregnant?!
Who did?!
You did!
"Yes. Yes, yes I did. But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing."
Oh? Really? That’s what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
"No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love Rachel."
What?!
"Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend."
Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?
Hey! I offered to marry her!
Wh…
But I didn’t want to.
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!
Tramp?!
"I’m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green."
"Excuse me, I-I couldn’t help overhearing, you’re marrying Chandler Bing?"
Yeah that’s right.
"Huh, good luck!"
"Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!"
Hey.
Hey.
"Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?"
I had one.
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
"Two it is. Ross, how about you?"
"Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two."
Really? Who's number two?
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
"Uh, no, it's-it's just this person."
Like a date type person?
"Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?"
"No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so..."
But you said one.
"I meant, me plus one!"
"Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?"
"Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!"
"Well, why do you call him Gandolf?"
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn’t you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
"No, I had sex in high school."
Hey!
Emily's cousin kicked me out!
What?!
Why?
"Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back."
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Who needs a lease when it's family!
"Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!"
Hi.
Chandler!
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there’ll be lots of little Bings.
"Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?"
"Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here."
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
"I know, how can you not be across the hall anymore."
"Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?"
"Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs across the street."
"Yeah, I remember."
"Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck."
"So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?"
"Naa, you keep it, you need the practice."
Thanks.
"So, I guess this is it."
"Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so."
"Hi Pheebs, what’s up?"
"Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need a small deposit."
What?!
"Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date."
"Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
"Oh, I see."
"Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor."
Is this what you had in mind?
I'll say.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
"Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light."
"Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs."
"Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?"
Uh-huh.
"Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!"
"Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley."
What?! You slept with Jason?
You'd already broken up.
How long?
A couple hours.
"Oh, that's nice!"
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
"You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook."
Thanks!
"Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend."
Yeah right.
Why is that so funny?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
"Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?"
"Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!"
"Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like “Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.”"
Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Phoebe?
Yes? Yes! Oh.
What are you doing?
"Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh."
Were you following me?
"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister."
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?"
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic."
"No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know  Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch."
"Uh-huh, I don't know."
"Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?"
"Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?"
"Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go."
"Come on man, you drove all the way up here."
"No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise."
Thank you.
"All right, we'll call you when we get back."
Okay.
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Okay.
"Or, or the rodeo!!"
That would be great.
Okay!
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
I know!
Hey!
Hi!
Rachel.
"Monica, this is Dan, one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica."
Nice to meet you.
"Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!"
"So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?"
Chandler!
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Oh.
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
"Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way."
"So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?"
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
"Oh, great!"
"Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?"
No.
All right. Very good.
Hey!
Hey!
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
"What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"
Your make-up!
"Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow."
"Yeah, but sandwich time is right now."
"Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it."
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
"All right, then you owe me $350."
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
Joey…
"All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you."
"What's the part, Anti-man?"
"Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy."
U-N-I-sexy?
"Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together."
We did?
"Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?"
"Yeah, right."
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Get out.
"I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back."
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
"Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?"
Nothing.
"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?"
Yeah. Oh.
What's wrong?
"I just remembered, I have to do something."
Oh. What?
"Um, leave."
"Wait, wait, wait!"
"Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here."
"Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it."
Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
"Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself."
"Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me."
"No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!"
"C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!"
"She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape."
"This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go."
"Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!"
Why have I seen this thing three times?!
It’s…still beautiful.
Uh! It’s horrible!
"I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Wait, you guys, look!"
What? Did her ass explode?!
"No, the baby’s out! Look, look!"
"Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!"
And look how happy the mom is now!
Oh…Rach!
"Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!"
"Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God."
What?
Nothing. Nothing.
What? What’s wrong?
"I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother."
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
"No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself."
"Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?"
"No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!"
"Okay, why are you here?"
"Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, Emily called you today."
You talked to her?
"No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine."
"Well, okay, what-what did she say?"
"Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her."
Wow!
"Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?"
"Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!"
"Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision."
"Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily."
"Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?"
"Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!"
"Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!"
"You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?"
"Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff."
Huh.
"I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?"
"That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her."
"Well, there you go!"
"Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day."
Close call day.
"Hey, thanks Rach."
"Ohh, honey no problem. Okay."
"Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
"Hey, Mr. Trib."
Hey-hey.
"Guess what, I got an audition!"
"Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud."
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
You bet! What's the part?
"Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer."
"OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!"
Is Tony Randall dead?
No.
I don't think so.
Why?
"Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car."
What?
Oh my God!
Really?
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one.  Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. Nice earrings.
Thank y...
"Girls, sit down."
"Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel..."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it."
"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?"
"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be..."
You did?
"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not."
"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?"
I did.
"Yeah, I think so, yeah."
Not me.
"Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did."
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
"No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."
"Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me."
The doctor will be right with you sir.
"Mommy, I can't find Waldo."
With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
"Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?"
"Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way."
"Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?"
I am a single parent.
"It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?"
"Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office."
"Rossy, we're ready for you."
"Hmm, yeah. Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in."
Mommy.
"Mommy, what's wrong with that man?"
"Hey, I helped you find Waldo!"
Phoebe! Hi!
Oh my God!
"Wow, you look unbelievable."
Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
"Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently."
What happened?
"Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?"
Yeah?
"Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done."
"Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?"
"Good, good, life is good..."
Good!
"Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone."
"Oh, good for you."
"She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said ""Boy, I want that""."
Mike and I broke up.
"You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up."
Really?
"Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face."
"I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!"
"Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?"
Well... no.
Do you wanna get a drink?
I'd love to.
Great.
Ok.
Do you smell beets?
"Oh, got it, stay upwind of me."
Hey!
Hi!
What's up?!
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
"Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?"
"Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good."
"Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!"
Okay. Umm…
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
"Okay, what's going on with you?"
Nothing! You go!
"Well, I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore."
"Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there's just not anything else?"
"Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?"
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
"Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller."
"Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!"
Yeah!
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
The Luisa from home room!
Yes!!
"You have no idea who I am, do you."
"No, none at all."
None.
"Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?"
"Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!"
"Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!"
What?!
"Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?"
"I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine."
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Hey you guys! Ok...we've got great news.
Phoebe and I are moving in together.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
"Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing ""This is what my sister would look like""."
Yeah...she's not so cute.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
OK...Well you put down the toilet seat.
Yes dear.
Is that a bit you guys do?
Uh huh...we're playing you two.
We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Yes dear.
I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's...that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys.
I hear wedding bells.
Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean...I don't know...Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah...You know...I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know...near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior... Oh my god I do.
Phoebe...I had no idea you were so conventional.
I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
You ready to go?
Yeah! You bet roomy!
Don't you mean...groomy?
What are you talking about?
Oh please...these guys...we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns.
China patterns!
"Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?"
"Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar."
"So you're free Thursday, then."
"Yeah. Oh, can I come?"
"Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?"
"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go."
I thought it was $98.50.
"Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup."
"Well, I'm off to Carol's."
"Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?"
"Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner."
I can't imagine what he sees in her.
"She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his. Oh, hello dear..."
"Hey, what's going on?"
We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?
A little better.
"By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter Jen."
"You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well-behaved and... single."
I'm not interested.
"Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real..."
"All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are..."
"Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth!"
"So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love..."
The woman you what?
Yeah... The woman you what?
The woman I love...  I love you... Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've ever met in my life...
I love you too...
You do?
YEAH...! How great is this...?
Wanna get out of here?
Okay.
"Mom, dad, thanks for dinner."
I had a great time. It was really top drawer. And here's something rich: thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
"What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?"
Now calm down Joey.
"No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!"
"Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing."
"Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…"
"Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?"
"No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool."
"So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!"
"Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!"
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
Okay.
When are you coming home?
"What? Guys, I'm not."
"C'mon, this is us."
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Waitressing?
"Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies."
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
"Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day."
What?
"We were shopping, and we had lunch."
"Oh, all right. What did I have?"
You had a salad.
"Oh, no wonder I don't feel full."
"Hey, guys, what's up."
"I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad."
"Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?"
"Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur."
You went shopping for fur?
"Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs."
You bought boobs?
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Y’know she has a face Ross!
"Okay. Okay, here’s a good one of us."
"Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow."
"Y’know, every year I say I’m gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?"
Together? Like-like to people?
"Yeah, y’know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It’ll be cute, okay?"
Okay.
"Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?"
"Uh sure, sure."
Bye guys.
Bye.
Congratulations! You just got married!
I know. Can you believe that?
"Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?"
"Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!"
"Hey-hey-hey, hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!"
"So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?"
"Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again."
Huh.
"Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says…"
Hey Chandler!
Hey!
"Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date."
"Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!"
"Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!"
Really? Right across the street?
Yeah!
When’d you meet her?
Two days ago.
Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!
Oh yeah?
Hey.
Hi! How’d it go?
Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation?
"Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not to worried about it."
Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
"So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what’s the name the girl you’re dating?"
Kristen Lang.
Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
"So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down."
"Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That’s me!! I’m blank!!"
How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down!
Yeah you are baby.
"Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?"
So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?
"No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no."
Why’d you say no?
"Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time."
If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
"Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?"
Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
"Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?"
"Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid."
"Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know."
"Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. Seriously, proud of you."
Yeah.
So? What do you think?
I think you were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
"Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that."
"Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?"
Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
"You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me,  I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!"
Over here.
Have a seat son. Hey!!
"Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?"
You mean your pink shirt?
Faded salmon color.
"No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt."
Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!
"Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s."
That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Well just ask Mona to give it back!
"I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die."
"Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane."
Oh my God!
Excuse me?
"Miss? Please, sit down!"
"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them."
"Miss, I can't let you off the plane."
Let her off the plane!
I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
"Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!"
Try to understand!
"Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off..."
No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
I got off the plane.
You got off the plane.
I do love you.
"I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again."
"Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again."
"Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid."
"Okay. You and me, alright? This is it."
This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Don't make jokes now.
You can not do this.
"Do what, do what?"
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do."
"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
"Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this."
Hi. She said yes.
"Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?"
Hey babe.
Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don’t like us do they?
Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
"No, it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?"
How about to the street say from the balcony?
Why don’t we just find a place for it?
Okay. How about in that cabinet?
No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
How about the closet by the bathroom?
"Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?"
"Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. It’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?"
No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
"Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?"
Feminine stuff.
Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
"Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you’ll let it go."
Fine.
Thank you!
Love you.
What ‘cha doing Mon?
"I’m making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared."
What are they?
"Well, so far I have uh, my bride’s maids dresses won’t get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don’t have my something blue."
Hey! Those are all the things I’m responsible for!
I had to go with the odds Rach.
Hi everyone.
"And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani."
"Well, Chandler's old roommate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone."
"Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles."
That had to hurt!
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
I will have one.
"Okay, I'm not gonna have one."
Neither will I.
"No, no, it's just my tooth."
All right I'll have one.
"So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one."
"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him."
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Why? Why can't you go to him?
"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies."
"That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse."
"Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!"
"Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'."
And all these people actually died?
"Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!"
"Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence."
"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead."
"Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? You!"
"Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, ""If it helps!"""
Why won’t you let me massage you?
Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be self-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked.
Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!
"That’s different, we were roommates! And when?!"
I’m curious about the human body.
"Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me."
"But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, if you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?"
"Okay, if it means that much to you…"
It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.
Dinosaurs.
"Potato, potaato."
I didn't know you knew about that.
"Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: ""Betrayal In The Common Room""."
Man... I... I'm sorry.
Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
"So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even."
Hmm mmmhm..
"We are even, right?"
"Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?"
"""Ooo,"" what?"
Uma Thurman.
Oh!
The actress!
Thanks Rach.
So what are you gonna do?
"You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?"
"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
She is gonna hate me.
"Yeah, well…"
"Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show."
It’s a pleasure to meet you Ray.
"And this is Duncan and Erin, they’re gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, let’s get the camera rolling."
Rightie-O Ray!
Whenever you’re ready.
"Hello, I’m Joey Tribbiani! Let’s play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?"
Wayne Gretzky.
"Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?"
"Uh Joey, didn’t your agents give you the revised rules? We’ve eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards."
What—Why?!
"Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn’t follow it."
Well what’s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You’re in Paradise Pond!
Yeah all that’s gone. It’s basically just a simple question and answer game now.
Well what’s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that’s just people standing around answering questions?
"Well, there’ll be women in bikinis holding up the scores."
Let’s play Bamboozled!
"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you."
"You mean, when you were a baby."
Sure.
"Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago."
"And yet, here we are doing it again."
"Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!"
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Got me.
"All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna happen!"
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
"I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!"
"Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!"
"Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off."
Why to save your dignity my man.
"Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?"
"I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!"
Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder!
What happened?
"Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism."
"But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?"
"Well, we got into a fight 'cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married."
You're getting married?!
"Oh, yeah!"
Wow!
My little brother's getting married!!
"Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?"
Do I?
Do you?
"Yeah, I do, yeah."
"Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiancée man!"
"Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married."
"Yeah, isn't it fantastic?"
"Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?"
"What, he's 18."
"Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party."
"Yeah, or-or to get a hooker."
Always illegal Joe.
"Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiancée, Mrs. Knight."
"Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all."
"Yeah, I'm a big surprise."
"Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?"
I'll take sports.
Mine!
"All right. Uhh, international."
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
"Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here."
Not even on page 7?
"Oh yeah! You're—hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!"
What about that circled one?
"Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio."
But it's available now! Isn't it?
"Yes, it is."
"Hey, let's go look at it!"
"Okay, let's go."
Okay!
There we go!
"Hey, Phoebs"
Hey.
"Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us."
"Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him."
What?
"Still, he had to find out sometime."
"Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?"
I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
Yes!
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
"Oh, how does he look? How does he look?"
So gross!
"Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?"
"Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure."
"Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?"
"Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, ""I'm over you."""
"Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo"
Hang on.
"Hello, excuse me."
What.
"Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute."
I'm talkin'!
"I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone."
"Alright, fine. I'll call you back."
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Good.
"Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure."
"Oh, no-"
"Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter."
"Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is"
"Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight."
I know.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
What's up Joe?
"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…"
Yeah?
"…is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, ""Who are my friends?"" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…"
What are you saying?
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
"Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up."
I'll treat you real nice.
"Yeah, well, y'know umm… No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!"
Won't-won't that take longer?
"Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait."
"Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!"
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning’s here! Morning is here—
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
"Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did."
"Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!"
"Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!"
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
Okay.
"See, this is a great apartment."
Shut up! This place is a hole!
Hi guys.
Hey.
"Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?"
Only if you say his full name.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
Alright.
You're getting a cat?
"Uh, actually, we're getting a cat."
Together?
Uh huh.
Both of you?
Yep.
Together.
"Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time."
"Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time."
Hopefully.
"Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave."
"I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am."
How long do cats live?
I'm sorry?
"Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?"
"Um, maybe 15, 16 years."
That's just great.
"Um, cheers."
"Oh, right, clink."
"Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?"
"Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend."
"Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh."
I mean he just started going out with her.
"Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?"
"Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you."
Alright.
"OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?"
"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there."
"Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?"
"I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move."
"Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?"
"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…"
"You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!"
Why?
"It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy."
What's going on?
We all hate Emily!
Nooo!!
"No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy."
Yeah!
"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable."
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
"Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!"
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
"Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either."
"Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names."
"Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you."
Regina Philange.
"I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong."
"I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes."
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
Well maybe it was all of your questions.
What about my questions?
"The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!"
"Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?"
Was that another question?
"I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah."
"I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour."
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
"All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell him, I’m gonna be strong."
I just called a friend of mine.
Yeah?
I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
"Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down."
What is it sweetie?
There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
What?!
I’m sorry daddy.
I don’t believe this!!
"Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please."
Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won’t marry you?! That’s it! Is that it?!
"Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods."
"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
"Well, you're gonna."
"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
No.
"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
You really think so?
Yeah. I really do.
"Thanks, Chandler."
Get off!
"Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column."
Can't we just use a pen?
"No, Amish boy."
"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first."
"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes."
You could say that.
"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress."
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
I don't know.
"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby."
"Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?"
She's not Rachel.
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
"It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears… But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, ""Where's Betsy?"" Right? And she says, ""Betsy's been dead for 10 years."""
"Ohh-oh, chilling!"
"And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!"
"Yeah, I know that means buddy!"
"Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!"
"Oh wait, my grandmother's dead."
"Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs."
"No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas."
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
"Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?"
"Oh umm, not go."
"All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?"
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Thank you.
"Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!"
"All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!"
"No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!"
Hi!
Hi!
That is one good looking man!
"Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!"
"Sooo, you’ve been doing this long?"
"No, you’re my first. Put the money on the table."
"Oh, yeah! Ooh, that’s nice."
Dude!
Is that an expensive blouse?
If you want it to be.
Here’s your girlfriend’s button.
Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!
"Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me."
"Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own."
"Sweetheart I know you’re gonna be terrific mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning."
"But mom, I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this."
Really? Remember Twinkles?
He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
"Okay, come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here."
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
"Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old."
"Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities."
"It's the only possibility, Phoebe."
"Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?"
"There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility."
I can't believe you caved.
What?
"You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?"
"That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!"
"Hey, hey, look at that talent."
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
"Hey, you. He's just adorable."
"Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink."
So what are you guys out doing today?
"Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff."
You done?
Yeah.
"Oh, there's our stop."
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
You guys live around here too?
"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk."
You know it?
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?"
"So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?"
"Oh, sure, they love us over there."
Where's your baby?
Ben! Ben! Ben!
"Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord."
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Well then we still have a problem.
Yeah!
With what?
"Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies."
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
"Phoebe, we’re getting married, married; not sixth grade married."
No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Are you serious?
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!
I call it!!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
"We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!"
"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
What what what what?
"Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot."
Ya think?
"The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?"
"No, was he any good in it?"
"Rachel, he like, totally changed time."
"Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?"
"Oh, yeah."
"What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?"
He could hear me.
"OK, I'm doin' it for ya."
"Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook"
Excuse me. Hi.
Hi.
"Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute."
You don't think I'm cute?
"I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?"
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
"I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?"
"Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!"
"Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?"
"Uh, no. No, we’re not."
But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
That’s right. But if you don’t want to know…
"No, no, we want to wait, right?"
Right. Right.
"Oh, I’ll be right back. And, uh, I know it’s really not my place, but please don’t name your child Phoebo."
"This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze."
It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.
"Well, I've...I've been blessed with a...a lot of great roles."
"Tell me about it! ""Unlimited nights and weekends!"""
"You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out.  I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service."
"No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials."
Really?
Yeah.
"Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role."
Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon...
"Peeeeeooooooooch ""Hang up that phone!"" One take!"
Wow!
"I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart..."
"Sandy, that's exactly what it is..."
Are you gay?
Ross!
It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.
Oh!
Her name is Deliah.
"Oh, that's pretty."
So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
"I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child."
Okay.
"Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in..."
"Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap."
"Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed."
"Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want..."
"Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him..."
"Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!"
"So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out."
"Because, it's weird!"
Why?
What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
Yes?
King?
I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... it keeps the hands young...
Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
That's great!  I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...
"Oooh... wow, come here."
You gotta be at least bi..
You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna have a baby!
MY SISTER’S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
"Oh, who’s this little guy?!"
Oh! Ooh! Umm!
"Oh, he’s so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour."
"You are so precious, I could just take you home."
"Hey, why don’t you?"
Are you serious?
"Uh-huh, yeah!"
"Oh, thanks."
What are you doing?
"No, I’m really okay with this. Y’know why? ‘Cause look at them, and I made that, so… I know it’s gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it’s gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby."
Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don’t know what this means to us! Oh!
"Oh my God, I think I’m gonna cry!"
It’s gonna be so great.
Hi! What’s going on?
"Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I’m gonna carry their baby."
But Phoebe…
"No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this."
"Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it’s just—that was my puppy."
Oh!
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
"You did so. I swear, I swear— How long has she been in the bathroom?"
"Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone."
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
That could be it.
"Oh, god.  You know, this is still pretty hot."
"Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny."
Hey!
Hey!
Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
"Yeah, there’s one right under the cabinet."
Thanks.
Why do you need it?
"Oh, we’re having a big party tomorrow night. Later!"
"Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?"
"Nooo, later."
"Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!"
Hormones!
"What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you’re having a party and we’re not invited?"
Hey!
Hi!
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming."
I thought I was a complete idiot.
"Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him."
"Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?"
I said no.
What?!
What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people.
"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?"
I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
"Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?"
"Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…"
"Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!"
"Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?"
"Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so …"
Wow! That is a bad audition.
How-how did you lose your job here?
"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me."
"He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right."
"Yeah, what are ya gonna do?"
"Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him…"
Okay.
What?
He can have his job back.
"That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back."
That’s great. Thanks Rach.
"Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?"
"Rach, you’re in my seat."
"Oh, I’m sorry."
"...And so then I realized. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn’t come to the wedding. Was all just a way of..."
"Oh, oh oh!! I’m sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person."
"Ehh, pardon me?"
"You say you love this man, yet you’re about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I’m afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan."
But he has to know how I feel!
But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
Well I-I think your wrong.
"Oh-no. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break."
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
"Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?"
"Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note."
"""Pheebs, can’t make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy."" Big Daddy?"
Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.
"Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!"
Hey!
Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!
"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!"
"Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule."
"I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!"
Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
"Well, it does."
"Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!"
"Okay, you wore me down."
"Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?"
The Ross—Is that back?!!
"Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off."
"I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?"
"Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?"
My name is Precious.
"Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours."
I just can't believe this... Why?
"Well, I don't..."
"Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?"
"Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you."
"I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?"
"Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God."
"Okay, not a fan of the tough love."
I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
"But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me..."
He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
"Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend."
"Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect."
"Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell."
You're welcome!
"Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost."
"Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win."
Is that a secret or a lie.
"No, I let him win—Ross!"
Yeah?
Would you tell her I let you win please?
"Oh. Yeah. Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler’s really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse!"
I am strong! I’ll show you!
Chandler please!
Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?
Let’s go big bunny!
Okay. 1…2…3—Go! I’m gonna kill myself!
Thank you guys for having us over.
"Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night."
"Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often."
"Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away."
"You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it."
Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I should have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
Well it depends.
On...?
On how far along he's in the sex change process!
"No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to, your eyebrows are..."
Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Wow! Talking about high maintenance
Hey hey! You dye your hair!
I'm a woman!
Arghhh! Double standards!
"Ok, careful."
Ok.
"Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!"
"Rach, she's got like three hairs!"
"I know but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out."
I promise you she's safe! No watch how much she loves this.
Ok.
"Sure, oh, is, is Frank home."
How do you know Frank?
"Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?"
Yeah. Frank.
Yeah. What?
"Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior."
He went out for groceries.
Ok so will he be back soon?
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
"Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry."
Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
Heavy.
"Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?"
No but he didn't really talk about anything.
Oh.
Except stilts.
Stilts?
"Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts."
Wow.
Yeah.
I don't know what to do with that.
Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
Yeah.
"This is huge, you can buy me beer."
"I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'"
I gotta friend named Mark.
That'll work too.
Well you’re only two centimeters dilated and we need to get to ten. It’ll be a while.
"Oh, okay."
I’ll be back in an hour to check you again.
Thank you.
"Thank you. Well, I guess we have some time to kill."
"Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! Never done this before."
Yeah well it looks great!
"It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that... she’s really really cute."
It doesn’t matter. You don’t dip your pen in the company ink.
"Ross, your little creature’s got the remote again."
"Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote..."
Great.
"Relax, I’ll fix it."
"Cool... ""Urkel"" in Spanish is ""Urkel."""
"Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got."
Rhythm?
"No, my first fan mail."
Alright!
"'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'"
"Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married."
"This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building."
"Oh my god, I got my very own stalker."
"Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister."
"Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out."
"Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?"
No?
Can I talk to you for a second?!
"Hey, Joey."
Hey.
Come on!!
"Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses."
I just got off the phone with my sister.
"Ah, which, which one?"
Mary-Angela.
Mary-Angela.
Yeah.
Y'know which one was she again?
"Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister."
It's gotta be the first one.
"Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree."
"Yep, I'm in a tree."
"Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!"
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
"Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot."
What?!
"Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner."
That chick can't handle my corner.
"Look, either you leave, or we remove you."
"Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer."
"Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations."
What are you talking about?
"Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part."
"Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?"
"Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges."
"Well, it’s better than us deciding."
"Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!"
No! Coins hate me!
"Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie."
"Hey there, you handsome thing."
"Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio."
"Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!"
Big night!
This is so cool!
"So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!"
"Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English."
"I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again."
"She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me."
"Well, I just called Joshua…"
"Oh, how did it go?"
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time."
What did he say?
"Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue."
"Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again."
"Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well."
"Yeah, maybe."
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Any luck?
"Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again."
Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.
"Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross."
"Hi, Josh."
Hi.
Dudes.
"So, did you play in college?"
"Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though."
"Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64."
"Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head."
Okay.  I'll miss you.
Dope!
"Wow, cute one!"
Very!
"I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum."
"Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go."
Lemonade? You ok man?
"Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show."
"Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?"
I fell down an elevator shaft.
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
What?
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
I have absolutely no idea.
That's... that's classic.
"Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!"
"If you want, I'll do it."
"I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't."
"God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry."
"You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard...... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK."
"Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd...."
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
"So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me."
"Oh, nobody's judging you."
"Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!"
"Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say…"
You two will have very hairy children.
"Okay, I didn't know you would say that."
Ross! Janice?!
"All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind."
"Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids."
So are you actually gonna see her again?
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
I am gonna see her again.
Damnit Phoebe!!
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
"Phoebe?  Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?"
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
"Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard."
Which Richard?
The Richard.
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
"Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?"
"Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?"
"It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him."
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Really?
"But again, Simmons. Go on."
"The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!"
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Oh my god.
Hey.
Hi.
What?
"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job."
"If it's not you, this is a horrible story."
"Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice."
"Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?"
"…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault."
"Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?"
"Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him. But, not while he’s still married."
"Okay, what about you? Wouldn’t you want a date?"
"Actually, I’m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me, so until I work that out…"
Whatever! What about you Meg?
"Well, I don’t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn’t date him. It’s just that he’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
What?!
"She said, ""He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."""
"This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?"
"Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her."
"We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!"
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
"Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times."
"Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, ""Well done!"" Bravo Meg."
"Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth——Nothing!!"
Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy.
I am so attracted to him right now.
What's going on?
"Well, my eye is a little itchy."
"Uhhh, mine too! Yeah."
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
"Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!"
"Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!"
"Okay, so Richard, Richard!"
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
You said she was bald.
"Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now."
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
"I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people."
"Ohh, well, this is just perfect!"
"Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay."
"Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!"
"Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality."
"Why, does she have a bad personality?"
"Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!"
"Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!"
"Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle."
"How do you do. Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! Did they have representation?"
"No, they-they weren't in the play."
We're not actors.
"Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face and her chest I could really put something together."
Could I borrow it?
Hi.
So? What-what-what happened?
It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
"Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business."
"Chandler, can you give us a minute?"
"Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?"
Yeah.
I’ll be in there.
"Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things…"
I know. I know.
"It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy I haven’t thought about our thing since all this."
"Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a little bit."
Yeah I know! I miss that.
Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
My gynecologist tried to kill me.
How sad are we?
"Yeah, I know."
"Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!"
Yeah!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Yeah!
"And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!"
"We’re 29, we’re not women."
Hi Daddy.
Baby. Ross.
Dr. Green. How are you?
Thanks for dinner last night.
Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
"Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore."
"What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here."
"Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go."
What?!
"Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that...."
"Look Amy, it got a little of control...Um... and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh... if it really means that much to you..."
So you're going to give me the baby?
Uh. No... I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
You are not going to regret this.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
Is it?
"Maybe not, is it?"
"Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... No, not... that's gum. Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there..."
"I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?"
"Oh, sorry."
"Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars."
It's to my apartment.
"Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike."
"Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because..."
"Oh no, I want to."
"Oh, thank God."
"Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go."
"Is this cool, huh?"
It really is.
Hey!
Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight!
"Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step."
Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
"They just gonna love you, just be yourself."
They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
"Oh yeah, she can't be herself."
"Okay, so... all right... Which dress? You can say ""neither""."
"Oh God, neither!"
"I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine."
"Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: ""Oh Mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."""
You went out with Wallis Pincer?
"Uh, he took the SAT's for me."
I knew you didn't get a 1400!
"Sssh yeah, well, duh! I mean..."
So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
"Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had."
She said WHAT?
That's she's like the daughter she never had. Listen!
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
"Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
'We' would be me and Rick.
Who's Rick?
Who's Rick?
My husband.
Ooooohhh.
"Oh, so you're divorced?"
No.
"Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
"No, I'm still married."
"So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?"
"Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan."
"Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?"
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
What?!
"Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?"
"No, sorry."
Well where's Amanda?
"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?"
"I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out."
"Ross, cough drops, please?"
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
"Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian."
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
"Ohh, that is soo sad."
"And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'"
Ahhhhhhhh!
What’s wrong?
Oh nothing I’m just—just was yawning.
"Oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight."
"Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?"
"Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining."
I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots tonight.
Why not?
"Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!"
Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
"Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it."
"You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!"
"Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on."
Okay.
Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!
"Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha."
I think she's OK.
"Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something.  Excuse me, are you Rachel?"
What?
"I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow."
"What are you, what are you doin'?"
"Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids."
"Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care."
"OK, see ya later, nice meeting you.  You're welcome."
Hey guys.
Hey.
"Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?"
"Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel."
"You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion."
Oh! Hi!
Hi!
"Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don."
"Oh, hello. Hello."
Soul mate.
What?
Soul mate.
"So, what have you guys been doing?"
"Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?"
"I know! What is this, 1985?!"
"That’s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn’t that strange."
Not really.
What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza? No?
"So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?"
"Well, Octavio, 27&7—Oh! And there’s this great little place, Alessandro’s."
"Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there."
You’re kidding me!
No!
"Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?"
"Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna talk about me, I’m gonna go with you."
What are you doing?!
Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…
"I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!"
"They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen."
"Phoebe, good work."
Yeah?
"Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him."
"Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else."
"Can you not look at me when I say this?  I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you."
"Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don’t wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you."
"Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!"
"No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you."
Why?!
Because I-I like you.
You like me?
Yeah! I mean you’re-you’re beautiful and smart and sophisticated—a lot of this isn’t based on tonight.
"Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!"
But…
"Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you."
"Okay uh, however…"
"Oh, now see that’s a fancy but."
"My marriage like just ended, and I’m really not ready to get into anything yet."
But….
"I’m sorry, I, I just need a little time."
Okay.
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
Did you get the grant?
"No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you."
What?
"Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up."
"Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man."
"Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of ""Underdog""?"
"I'm sure he was just joking, Ross."
"If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question."
Seriously?
"Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?"
"Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O..."
Damnit!
"Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?"
Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?
"No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict."
"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?"
"No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom."" He may think I’m sick."
"Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it."
"Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?"
Pretty much.
All right.
"Hey, how do you spell suspicious?"
Why?
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
"Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0."
You're driving me crazy with that!
"Okay, I'll stop."
Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
What—why?
Because Purvry Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.
What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
"Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now."
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
"Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?"
Wafer thin ice!
Oh hey you guys!
Oh hey!
Hi!
"Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?"
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.
"Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs."
I don’t need any toner.
"I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner."
Not me.
May I ask why?
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
I surely do!
"Okay, I don’t need any toner because I’m going to kill myself."
"Umm, is-is that because you’re out of toner?"
"Okay, that was Mike."
"Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration."
"Huh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, okay, I'm gonna take off."
What?
"Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not the kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye."
"Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?"
"You know, I think that's a good idea. Our babysitter just pounded down another Chardonnay. Bye, you guys."
Bye.
"See ya. Well, this is just us."
"Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?"
Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
"Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant!"
Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant?
Oh yeah. That’s me.
Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?
"Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby!"
"Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?"
You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
David Lynn.
David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
Who’s David Lynn?
Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
"Come here, Marcel. Sit here."
"Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?"
Just a smidge.
"David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical."
I think it's romantic.
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Yeah!
"Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions..."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact."
"No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?"
"Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
What?!
"C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!"
"I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped."
"Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!"
"I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"
Hi you guys!
Hey!
Oo...what's in the bag?
"Oh er...well you know Emma started crawling? I realized that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment."
"Oh...baby-proofing...Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know...when I was a kid it was like... ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" or er... ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!"
Anyway erm...Are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
No. I was just going to do this myself.
You're gonna do it?
Yeah...Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Oh...Women can. You...can't.
Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
You're a pig. And you can't do this.
Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
The hardware store is right down the street.
There is a hardware store right down the street?
"I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks."
"Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike."
I am Mike.
Atta boy!
"Okay, look..."
"Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?"
"How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that."
From school.
"Yeah, we met in college. I mean, high school."
"Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?"
"Well, I'm a lawyer."
"Mike, 'attorney at law'!"
"Actually, I just gave up my practice."
What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
"I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will."
"Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so..."
Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
"No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail."
"No, no, no."
"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!"
"Hey, I gotta! Unless..."
Unless what?
Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
What? Why?
"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name."
Your family name is Tribbiani.
...You almost had me.
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?"
"Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname."
"Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday."
There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!
"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers."
"So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y’know, I’m kinda musical."
"Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she’s even had time to…"
"Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?"
"Yeah, you’re on your own."
Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
"But I-I-I can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?"
"So when you said, ""Get up early,"" did you mean 1986?"
You guys don’t think I look 19?
"Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!"
"Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!"
Okay.
Okay.
"Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?"
"Oh honey no, you ate it all."
I was afraid of that.
"Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits."
"Ooh, my first birthday present.....oh, this is really..."
"Oh, no no no. It’s for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise."
"Ohhh... Sure, yeah.....okay, it fits."
Are you seein’ her again tonight?
Yep. Ice Capades.
"Wow, this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kind of capade."
"I don’t know. I like her, you know. She’s different. There’s uh, somethin’ about her."
"That you like,  we get it. You like her. Great!"
"Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go."
Okay.
Okay!
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Yeah. That's Daddy.
That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
"Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers."
So?
"So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change."
Hey guys!
Hi Janine!
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year’s Eve. It’s called some sort of Dick’n Rock’n Dickie Eve.
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?
"Yeah, that’s what I said."
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
"Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you?"
Well I’m gonna be on it this year. I’m gonna be one of the party people.
You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.
Well actually they’re taping tomorrow. I don’t really understand why.
"Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that."
"Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?"
Are you serious?
We are there!
"I’d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, ""Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!"" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I’m sorry. And-and some scared memories—Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I’ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple!"
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
Who was that?
"Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes."
"Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person."
"Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?"
Yeah!
Hey!
Don't come out here!
"No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!"
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
"Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!"
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
"Uh, what was that?"
"Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right."
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
It depends on who asked.
What if I asked?
"Oh, Mon, sure."
Really?
Yes. You’re not asking are you?
No.
Yes! Totally!
"Hi, we’re the Rostins. Err, I’m J.C., and he’s Michael, and we’re having a boy, and a girl."
"Good for you. Alrighty, next?"
"Hi, um, I’m err, I’m Ross Geller, and err ah.....that’s, that’s my boy in there, and uh,  this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol’s, just, com.....who’s next?"
"I’m sorry, I didn’t get... Susan is?"
"Susan is Carol’s, Carol’s, Carol’s, friend..."
Life partner.
Like buddies.
Like lovers.
You know how close women can get.
Susan and I live together.
Although I was married to her.
"Carol, not me."
"Err, right."
It’s a little complicated.
A little.
But we’re fine.
"Absolutely. So, twins... hah! That’s like two births. Ouch."
"Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you."
You do? Why?
"Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window."
What?! Why did you do that?
"I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter."
How could it not matter?!
"How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?"
What about all that “friends forever” stuff?
"I don’t know, I-I was all high."
Hey!
Hello.
I need to talk to you!
"Sure, what's up?"
"Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler."
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
"Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase."
"Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you..."
"Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!"
"That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?"
"Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it."
"Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me."
Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?
"Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having."
"Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?"
"Some would say she’s attractive, yes."
And who else is going to be there?
"Uh, some of her friends, yeah."
Her dancer friends?
"Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go!"
"Dude, we were good!"
"You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!"
"Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgiving."
"Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner."
"Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!"
Men are here.
We make fire. Cook meat.
"Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back."
Ewww!
"Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late."
"Oh, OK."
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
"I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great."
"Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?"
"Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything—minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan."
"Uh actually, I’d like to speak with both of you."
"Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?"
"Umm, no. Thanks, but I’ll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?"
"Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly."
"Well, I’d be forced to file a report. I’d have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy."
Well…
"All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park."
"Ohh, give him a kiss for me!"
"All right, bye!"
Bye!
Bye!
Later!
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
"Wow umm, calm down."
"I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!"
Why are so mad at him?
"Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?"
"Well, it just seems that…"
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seen my list by the way?
"Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?"
"Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, ""Ross"" on it."
Ha!
"So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!"
"Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four..."
Tequila!!
That's fun.
"Pheebs, I still need some help here"
"Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying."
Oh... I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know... I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrific actor.
You are a terrific actor.
"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
That's the rule.
"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
How'd you get to that?
"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
You knew about that?
"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
Yeah
You think we're ready for something like that?
Why not?
"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
"Why, are you moving out?"
I'm not moving out.
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
"Aw, I know all about Kip!"
"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
"Aw, don't do that"
"Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?"
"I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica.  This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica."
"Hi, nice to meet you!"
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Nice to meet you Monica. Bing!
"Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?"
"No, sir."
"Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe."
"Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight."
What was that?
What?
That noise you just made?
"Oh, that was my work laugh."
Really? Your work laugh?
"Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too."
"All right, check me out."
Okay.
"Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck."
Or... Dick.
Hey!
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
Move in with me.
What?!
"Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be."
"Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there."
I know.
My job!
"Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!"
"Yeah, but it-it-it’s my whole life—you come to England."
"No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?"
"Ohh, I don’t think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future –and-and-and we were getting married or something."
What?
"Oh no, no, right I shouldn’t have said married. Uh, please don’t go freaky on me. I didn’t mean it. Well, I didn’t say it; I take it back!"
"No, no, don’t. Why don’t we?"
Why don’t we what?
Get married.
You are mad!
"No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want."
We’ve only known each other for six weeks!
"Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?"
My parents are going to be really mad.
Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Yes.
Yes!
Yes! We’re getting married?!
Oh my God!
Yes!
We’re getting married!
"Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?"
Yes.
"Ohh, it’s a bit small."
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
It was.
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
That's right baby.
"All right, let me in."
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
What?
He's a dropper!
"Oh yeah, that's right!"
I'm not a dropper!
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?"
It's throwing and catching!
All right.
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Hey!
Hey!
"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?"
"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries."
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?"
"Well, Phoebe set me up on a date."
Oh my god.
Wow.
Why? What's the big deal?
"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are..."
"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set."
"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!"
"You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah,"" and send out a resume!"
So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
"Oh, it's perfect."
"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!"
Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
"Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!"
Oh my God!
Wow!
What is the matter with you?!
No! Barry and Mindy.
"Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?"
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
"Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?"
"Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me."
Why did they get divorced?
"Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?"
"Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?"
"No, of course we're not."
Insane.
I know.
"Alice would never go for it, right?"
"Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard."
"Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?"
Huh.
Frank Jr.Jr.?
"Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke."
Uh-huh.
"What's green and says ""hey, I'm a frog""? A talking frog! Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny."
"Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?"
"Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet."
"Alright, so that leaves Chandler."
"Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor.."
"Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids."
"Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies."
"I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there."
How about tomorrow?
"Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together."
You'd do that for us?
Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
"Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!"
"Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?"
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Maye it's me.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
"You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody."
There we go. All better.
There's my little boy.
Can I uh see something?
Cool.
He hates me. My nephew hates me.
"Come on, don't do this."
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
"Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat."
Rachel?
Yeah.
"I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine."
"Well, sure, but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore."
Oh my God. What happened?
"I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren."
Well that’s great! Congratulations!!
Yeah. A year ago..
You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.
"But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much."
That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.
I don’t think mine likes me either.
Maybe it’s a universal thing?
"Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday."
Yeah let’s head off to work.
We should go.
"Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon."
"Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something."
All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
"I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you."
What?! They took mine to give to you!
Why would they take away our keys?
Maybe they don’t trust us.
"All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it."
"No, you don't."
"All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it."
"What is this? Ross, what is this?"
"Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?"
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
"Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot."
Just a waitress?
"No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?"
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
"Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square..."
"There y'go, kids."
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
You seen Sandy?
"Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you."
"I know, I know. Hello."
Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
Hi Rob Dohnen.
"I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great."
"Oh, wow."
"Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?"
"Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them."
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out."
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
"Fine, I’m mentally unstable."
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
What?!
"Uh yes, heroin and crack."
Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!
"Well, you would know."
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
"Oh, come on!"
"Ross, please, I found the magazines!"
"And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin."
"Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!"
That won’t be necessary.
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Ugh!
"Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem."
"Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike ""Consummated like bunnies"" from the record?"
"Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?"
"Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think."
"Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce"
"Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... Okay, bye bye. She was nice!"
"Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!"
Whoo-hoo!
You're kicking me out?
You put holes in my baby's ears!
"Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!"
I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
"You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative."
Excuse me?
"You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws And suddenly I am the bad guy?"
"Joey, where are those bags?"
She has a lot of crap!
"You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way..."
Seriously?
hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
Hips or thighs?
Ass and face.
Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
"She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff."
"Oh, I can give you that."
You can?
"Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are."
"Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute."
Did you just say Emma?
"Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella."
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
"Oh sure, Cilantro Larry."
"Well, I’m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter."
"Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people."
"How could you say yes, what about our catering business?"
"Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners."
Yay!!
"Oh, in that case——Yay! That was me hopping on board."
Oh.
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
You're kidding.
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
...Flame Boy.
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Booo!!
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
"Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine."
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
What a wank!
"Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses."
"I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way."
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
But you are a liar.
What did I just say?
You still here?
"Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something..."
"Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!"
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
"Well, this is going well."
"Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan."
And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape!
He really is a chameleon.
Monica.
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
"Honey, I'm just checking."
Oh.
Monica.
Mon.
Monica.
Mon.
"So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!"
"So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good."
"Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!"
Oh hey Rach!
Yeah...
Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
"Oh, well..."
I'm sure you have better things to do.
What uh—What did you—What?!
"I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did."
Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!
"Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you."
Oh God… Why don’t they put chairs back here?!
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
"Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!"
What were you doing in Africa?
Working with blind kids.
"Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen."
"Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler’s willing to give you everything I am."
"Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!"
You are?
Yeah!
Why?
Why? Because of the government.
Hey good scene man.
Hey you too!
Alright.
What? You weren’t in it.
Oh!
"Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?"
Yes?
"This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel."
Hi.
Hey! How come I haven’t seen you here before?
"Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that, I’m just stroking your arm."
Here we go! Here we go!
"Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash."
Bye.
Say hi to Wally.
"Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!"
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
"Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler."
What?!
"I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, ""I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."" And he said, ""Laundry? Is that my new nickname?"" And you said, ""No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."""
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone."
"Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big……ot."
What?!
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Me and Chandler?!
Speech! Come on Monica!
Come on!
Come on! Speech!
"Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!"
"Oh-ho, I think it’s nice."
I think it’s necessary.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…
Wooo!! Hoo!!
"I really like to say that I’m-um… Y’know what I’d really like to say? I’m drunk!!  That’s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I’ve been drunk before! And I’ve smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It’s all okay. It’s okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up."
"Okay quick, help me get this off!"
Yeah!!
Chandler what are you doing?!
Chandler!!
Oh my God!
You're smoking again?!
"Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still."
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
"Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place."
Weren't you nine?!
"Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time...."
Hi there!
"Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?"
"Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate."
This has been torn up.
And... taped back together.
"Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready."
Ok
Have a seat through the glass doors.
through the glass doors.
Through the glass doors.
Alright-y then.
"Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room."
"Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?"
"Sorry, everyone is booked!"
But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
Then why you work here?
'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
"Well, I think this is a great place to work!"
"Ok, are they listening?"
Five! Four! Three! Applause!
"Yeah! Welcome, it is Soap Opera week here on Pyramid, let's meet our contestants. First, Gene Lester is a database specialist, he's gonna be playing with ""Days of Our Life's"" star Joey Tribbiani!"
"I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! Only better looking and richer."
"...should be playing with the star of ""General Hospital"" Leslie Charleson. Welcome everybody. Good luck to all of you. Let's play Pyramid. All right? Now... we flipped a coin before the show, Gene, you won the toss, so you're gonna start. Which category would you like?"
"I'll take ""You crossed the line""."
"You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!"
"Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my..."
Diary.
"Noo, more like a notebook... Damn it! Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey... In high school, I once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the..."
Cafeteria.
Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for. OOOH!
"Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers."
That is so made up!
"Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!"
Yay!
There you go.
"Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye."
"Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store."
They loved it.
What?
They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
They thought Joey was a child?
"She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings."
Hi!
"Hi, Rach."
Hi!
Hey.
Hey.
"Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?"
"I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there."
That's not Ross!
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
"Okay, Ross is in the bathroom."
"Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip."
"Hey, you're not Kip!"
Do you even know who Kip is?
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
"Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together."
"Oh, that poor bastard."
"See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!"
You're not gonna be phased out!
"Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go."
Ehh!!
"Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out."
I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!
"Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay."
"Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?"
That’s not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
"Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!"
Like what?
"Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!"
"Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?"
"No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks."
There’s nothing to discuss. We’re not paying for your wine cellar.
You-you have to meet me in the middle here.
"Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass."
Dad!!
What-what’s going on?!
"Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control."
"You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? You want a piece of me?"
"Okay! Okay! That’s it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That’s right!!"
"Okay, okay."
"Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know."
What was all that about?
It was...This disagreement over...My god. You...you look beautiful.
Ohh...Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It’s bad luck.
"You know what, I think we’ve had all the bad luck we’re going to have."
"Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency."
"Oh my God, who died on this?!"
"Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?"
"Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to..."
"Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined."
"Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw."
"Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank."
"All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!"
"Free cats do that too, y'know."
It's not a cat!
"Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!"
"Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel."
Yes that would be lovely.
"You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!"
"Yes, you can pass for 19."
Really?
Yes!
Seriously?
"Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!"
I’m 30!
"Joey, you are not! You’re 31."
Aww crap!
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
"All right, you ready?"
"No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
"You can, I know you can!"
I don't think so.
"... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?"
Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
"Right. My name was on there, but now it just says ""carrot cake"". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?"
All of them.
"Oh yeah, so you know D?"
Yeah.
"Ok, do you know A minor?"
Yeah.
"Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?"
Yeah.
"Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?"
No.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
…just because you’re not in love with the guy you can’t…
"Wow, you told your dad the truth."
About an hour ago.
Wanna go see a movie?
Yes! Bye daddy.
…there’s gonna be a wedding! That’s unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love! …constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the consequences of your decision.
Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! What gives you the right to… Go to hell! Stupid guy on my phone.
What are you doing here?!
"I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays."
What?!
"Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you’re just mean! So, just tell me the truth!"
"All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni."
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
"No, no, that’s just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I’m very sorry, but I don’t know where your Father is, and that’s the truth."
Oh.
"But umm, you’re right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I’m your mother."
Heh?
"Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and…"
So what are you gonna do?
"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up."
"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?"
"Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!"
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny."
Why? What happened to him?
"Nothing, he’s just really believes in that."
"Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!"
"Oh, oh! It's on again!"
"You guys, can we please not watch this all right."
Shhhh!
"Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open."
"Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
And there is Kevin.
Can we please turn this off?
"Noo way, Kevin."
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Are you intrigued?
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
"Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton."
"Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday."
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Hang on buddy!
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
I sure did.
Why?
"Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend."
"Well, you're amazing."
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
"A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?"
"Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account."
"Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had."
"Oh, I don't know."
Did I just throw this?
Hi.
Hi.
I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this?
"Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I don’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella."
"Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I’ve got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can’t stop it."
"C’mere. Hey. C’mere. That’s Rachel. She’s the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you—we love her. But we can’t have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You’re a guy."
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Needs some clothes altered?
"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
"Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?"
You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
"Monica, there are no words… There are no words! This should not be this hard!"
"All right, uh… Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?"
"Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise."
"I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!"
"Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here."
Yeah.
Okay.
Go ahead.
"Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross."
Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Why are you laughing?
"Because, because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, ""You are such an idiot!"""
"Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding."
"I'm sorry, that's not funny."
"Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. ""Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?"" Don't know!"
"Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?"
"Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…"
"The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily."
That is what the thing is.
"Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?"
"No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you."
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
No thank you for… Thank you.
Stop sending food to our apartment.
"Well, why're you all dressed up?"
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
What? You have a date? Who with?
No one.
"C'mon, what's his name?"
Nothing.
"Come on, tell me."
"Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental."
"Oh, I promise, what."
It's Richard Burke.
"Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad."
"Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with."
Doctor Burke is sexy?
"Oh God, absolutely."
"Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once."
When?
"When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here."
Oh you are so lucky.
I know.
"Pheebs, I wanna ask you something."
"Uh-huh, what?"
Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful…
Oh!
…how about I move in with you?
"Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?"
Who’s Denise?
My roommate.
You have a roommate?!
"Yes, Denise. Denise!"
"Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?"
"Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?"
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
"Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place…"
"Oh, that’s true."
"Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?"
"Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place."
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!
Hey!
"Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!"
Why? Why would you do that?
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Ankle.
We'll see.
So what’s your name?
Chandler.
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must’ve had terribly fascinating parents.
"Oh, they’re a hoot."
And who is your friend?
I’m-I’m Monica.
Monica! Where are you from?
New York.
"I’m not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?"
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Really?! Congratulations. When’s the big day?
In…in two weeks.
"I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you’re bald?"
Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.
We?
"I know it would make me happy, ma’am."
Well I wouldn’t miss it for the world. Oh! I’m getting all misty here! You’d think I was having my legs waxed or something.
You okay?
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
You guys hear a ringing?
What the hell is this?
"Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!"
"Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out."
I didn't know Monica had these!
"Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!"
Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
"Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard."
"Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me."
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
You can not do this.
"Do what, do what?"
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do."
"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
Which one was Pete Carney?
"Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  ""Was it good for you?"""
"Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once."
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
"There's more beer, right?"
"Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
"Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
"Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect."
"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
Or?
"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
Burning's good.
"Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
"So, thank you for the delicious dinner."
You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Hey what are you guys looking at?
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
"Yeah, come to papa."
I know!
"Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?"
"Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?"
"Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?"
"Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era."
"Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era."
"I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow."
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Fine by me; hope she wins.
Hey Phoebe.
"Hey Leslie, how’d you know I’d be here?"
"I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm...."
"All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big fish or just one big fish."
"So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles."
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
"Ah, anything we might of heard of?"
"Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away.."
Home is Home Star stew.
"Yeah, but, I don’t do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn’t come up with anything good, so they fired me."
"Hmm, bummer."
"Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you’d want to get back together?"
No. But thanks.
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
Okay. No. But thanks.
"Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs."
"Wow, that was kinda brutal."
"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior.  Can I have a tissue, please?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Rache, can I get some coffee?"
"Yeah, sure."
Thank you.
"Hey, Rache, can I get--"
Did you talk to him?
Not yet.
"Then, no."
"That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going."
"Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?"
"Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie..."
"Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon."
You're welcome.
"Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love."
"This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca..."
Hey.
"Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!"
"We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!"
"Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!"
"Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man."
"Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!"
"But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!"
"Phoebe, you have to calm down."
"Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!"
Really?
Yeah!
You heard them say that?
Yeah!
"All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!"
Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
"No, what?"
"Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!"
"No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!"
Why not!
Because I already did!
"Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com."
"Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore."
"Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!"
"Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you."
I love you too. And... I like you as a friend.
All right. See you later!
See ya!
Did that guy really make that joke?
Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard.
"Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you’re gonna have a bachelor party."
What?
"Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!"
Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…
Will you let the lady talk?!
"Come on! Come on, it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so much better."
"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore."
"So don’t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…a two month anniversary present."
"Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!"
Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!
Yeah!
And Joey.
"Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?"
"Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough."
"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight."
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby…
Hey!
Hey!
Hi!
"So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?"
Sure!
I'd love to!
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
Santa!
Hey!
"What are you doing here, Santa?"
"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?"
"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?"
What?
"Did you bring me any presents, Santa?"
"You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!"
"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say."
"Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?"
"Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie..."
"What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?"
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
I'm on it!
Anything?
I think I hear curtains closing...
We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
"Bedsprings, unmistakable!"
You do realise that's your brother?
"Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with."
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
"Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon."
Okay Buckwheat!
"You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn!"
That was kind of rude!
"Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me."
"You know, he was just doing his job..."
"Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this."
"Oh, come on Ross..."
"No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with..."
Oh... That's true.
Thank you!
"Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it."
Nana is on the phone.
"Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!"
She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
"Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?"
"No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?"
Menstrual cramps.
I don't think that's what this is.
"Hey, remember when I had a monkey?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, what, what was I thinking?"
"Hey! So, what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?"
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!
I see where you’re goin’!
What’s up with the greed Joe?
"All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth—Why did I do that?!"
"Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?"
"Hey, is Rachel here?"
No.
She's still at dinner?
I guess. Why? Who's she with?
That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
"So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute."
Excuse me?
Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
"For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents."
"Oh, sorry!"
"Well, you kids take the train in?"
"No, Richard Burke gave them a ride."
"Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city."
"Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom."
"Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section."
Are we still on that?
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
"She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up."
"So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?"
"Well Joey doesn’t like to talk about it but, he’s one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives."
"That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman?"
A woman in a man’s body.
Much better.
"So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?"
"Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son."
"Yeah, little Eric."
"That’s right! Wait no, Ben."
So you’ve just married the one time then?
Well umm…
You’ve been married twice?
"Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?"
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
"Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?"
Do you two know each other?
No. No.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Monkey lover!
"Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I’ve decided to accept the fact that you’re going out with her."
"Really? That okay, that’s great."
"Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I’m funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I’m telling you, I don’t want you seeing my daughter anymore."
"All right look, I-I realize it upsets you."
Yes it does.
"But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it."
I’ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
Hi.
Hi.
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
"Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?"
Thanks.
"Oh, oh, c'mon in."
I'm Tilly.
Oh.
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
"Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul."
He's kind of intense huh?
"Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little..."
A little what?
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Hello Tilly.
"Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank."
That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
"Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye."
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Hi Monica!
Hey Mon!
Hey Mon!
"Oh my God, has she slept at all?"
Nope.
"No, it's been three nights in a row."
"Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so."
"Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call."
"Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question."
"Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look."
"No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket."
"Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking.  'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'"
"Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?"
"Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?"
"Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan."
"Ok, that's Eric."
Glad to be of help. Matches.
"I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?"
I don't know.
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
"I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings."
"So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag."
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
"Ok, this could be tough."
"Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar."
"Ooh, you almost had it."
Hi
Hey! Hi!
How was the honeymoon?
"Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!"
Oh!
"So, where's Mike?"
"Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!"
Hey guys!
Hey!
"Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend."
That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
"Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!"
Yeah!
We're having a party.
"Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?"
No.
"No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!"
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
"C'mon you guys, this is really important to us."
"Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally."
There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
"Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?"
"Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister."
"And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!"
"All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party."
"Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party..."
"Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!"
"Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!"
"Great job with the cups, Pheebs!"
Why don't you just go out with her!
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
Awesome!
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Y'know…go! Go! Right there!
Thank you! Thank you!
"Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!"
Oh my God! Whoah!
"Well, what's the part?"
"Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! ""I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"""
"Seriously, what-what's the part?"
"""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"""
"C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?"
...I'm his
"..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?"
"...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt."
Oh my God.
"C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!"
"Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business."
"Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!"
"You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?"
Hey Chandler.
Hey Gar!
"Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?"
Yeah! Okay.
You look very pretty today.
Thanks! Okay.
Here's the thing.
Yeah?
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Uh-hmm.
"Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards."
"No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this."
Phoebe?
Yeah?
I want you to move in with me.
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
"Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it."
I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Uh-huh.
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Yeah.
Which is why my answer is yes!
Really?!
Uh-huh! I'm so…happy.
"What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
I'm gonna do this now.
Oh my God!
"Phoebe, I..."
Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
Ready?
Uh-huh!
"Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?"
Yes!
I love you!
I love you more!
Oh my God! David!
Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
"No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?"
"Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing."
"Who cares, it got you here."
"Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it."
Wow. Where is your luggage?
Damn it!
"A-All right, well... I'll call the cab company."
"Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!"
"Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good."
"Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone?"
No...
"It's like this, me, no jokes."
"All right, stop it, you're freaking me out."
"Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later."
"Bye, Richard."
"Bye sweetie, I love you."
"I love you, too."
"I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like."
Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!
"Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?"
I hope you’re going somewhere with this.
Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna be an incredible mother.
Really?
I’m telling you.
Thank you.
"All right you two, I’m gonna get going."
Oh.
"Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out. It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t."
You’re still so funny. You’re so funny. What do I do?
"Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for it."
Y’know what? You’re-you’re right.
"Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off."
Really?
Uh-huh!
"Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! But what you’re doing to me now is just plain spiteful!"
Spiteful?!
That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!
"Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…"
"So whenever you’re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! I can’t feel my legs!"
You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!
Yeah? I’m proud of me too.
You should be!
Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
You got it!
"Okay. Mrs. Green! Okay I’m really sorry!! I’m apologizing for the—Okay, I bit my tongue, but I’m still really sorry!"
"Well, any how, somehow I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and selfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it’s like to be eighteen years old?"
"Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand."
"Well, I’m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn’t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don’t know, you’re here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you."
"Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you."
Wait!
I don’t ever want to see you again!
"Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry."
"Oh, thank you..."
"You still don't know my name, do you?"
"Well, now I don't have to."
Hey!
"Hey, hubby!"
"Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?"
Uh-huh.
I’m not going to do that.
"Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren."
"Oh, hi!"
Hey.
"Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar."
"Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day."
"Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la... Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production."
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is...  Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! Excuse me!!"
Anyone mind if I save this?
"Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye."
Nooo!
I know!
"Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!"
What?! We can't do that!
"We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?"
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!
"I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?"
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
"No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?!  Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people."
Ugh!
"Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him."
"Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!"
Your messages have been erased.
Noooooooo!
"Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now."
"Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?"
Uhhhooo.
"C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them."
"Well, there's you."
Better not be doin' these in order.
"Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo."
"Oh yes, the weenie from Torino."
"Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him."
Really?
"Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head."
Surprise.
"Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great."
Happy birthday sweetie.
"Wow you, you. I had no idea."
Really?
"No, I knew."
All right.
"Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall."
What?
What?
"Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now."
Why.
Just go.
Surprise.
Happy birthday sweetpea.
Daddy.
"Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this ""best wishes"" crap. I want ""love""."
"Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number."
Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
It was nice to meet you Rachel.
Nice to meet you.
Call me.
Ok
We will!!
Look at you with all the guys!
Yeah!
I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
"Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!"
Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy!
"Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!"
Hey happy Thanksgiving... Pheebs!
"Hey, what's going on Joe?"
I... I... I need a good lie.
"Oh okay. How about the whole ""man walking on the moon"" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!"
"No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today."
"Ooh, honey. You stink at lying."
I do not.
"Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?"
"Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said... He said... ""Joey you stink at lying."" What am I going to do?"
"Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it."
"Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you."
"Sure, what... what was the work thing?"
Uh...
"""Pick up grandma at the airport""?"
Oh... man...
"Honey, you gotta talk to her."
I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
"I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, ""I love you,"" was, ""Oh crap!"""
"Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they’re hungry."
"All right so, so what do I do?"
"This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try."
Yeah. Okay.
"Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I’d like you to meet Dennis Phillips."
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
"Oh, I’m so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions."
"Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show."
"I don’t believe we’ve met, Joey Tribbiani."
Dennis Phillips
"Wow, I’ve admired your work for years. You-you’ve done some really amazing stuff."
"Oh, thank you. Well if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment."
"Hey Erica, c'mon in."
"How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?"
"Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?"
"Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?"
Who?
Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
"It's not what you think, that was..."
You told me I was the only one.
"Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor."
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
Somebody wanna help me out here?
"Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date."
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
"'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun."
So when do we get to meet the guy?
"Let's see, today's Monday... Never."
"Oh, come on! Come on!"
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
"Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out."
"Well, then can we meet him?"
Nope. Schhorry.
I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!
Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
"Hey Joey, I want to talk to you."
"Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler."
"Hi, how are ya?"
"Joey, Joey, I-I-I’ll g-get you your job back if you help me out."
Why should I help you?!
The reason he just said.
What do you need?
"I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y’know Sarah?"
Yeah?
I wish I could talk to her.
What are you in love with her or something?
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
"Yeah, I’ve been there my friend."
"Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do."
"Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach y’know? It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you——You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it."
"I've had a very long, hard day."
"Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"
"Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then."
Okay.
"Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken."
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!"
"Now, have you told anyone else?"
"No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out."
You told me.
"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet."
Me too.
"This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller."
It-it’s great to meet you Paul.
I usually prefer Elizabeth’s boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
"Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens."
"So Ross, what your problem?"
Eh-wh—Excuse me?
Why can’t you get a girlfriend your own age?
That’s funny. Umm…. It’s not funny.
I don’t like you going out with my daughter Ross.
"Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind."
Okay.
What?
Okay. I’ll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute.
Daddy!
Fine! Two minutes. Go.
This is—you—
1 minute 50 seconds.
"Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I’ve been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student—I mean I not—not it! I mean, I mean I don’t—We haven’t done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we’ve-we’ve-we’ve done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke—lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish."
I’m Irish.
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
"Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!"
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
"Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second."
"Hey, dude!"
"Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?"
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
"Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering… Okay, I guess he ran out of change."
"Oh, hi, darling!"
"Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?"
"Oh, well we cut the trip short."
France sucks!
"Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here."
"Oh, say no more!"
"We’ll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we’ll be right out of you hair."
"Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn’t even get to Italy?"
"Yep, sucks!"
Dance with him.
"Mom, I'm hungry."
Dance with your father.
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Alright.
"Oh, Jack."
"Oh, Judy. Oh, Judy."
"Oh, ohhhhh."
Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go! Come on! Why aren’t you dressed yet?!
"I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out."
"No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding."
"Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit."
"Fair enough, now go get ready!"
Okay.
...How long was I in there?
I'm just cleaning up.
D'ya.. uh.. Do you need any help?
"Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!"
"Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?"
Oh.. a little..
Mm-hmm..
A lot.
Mm.
"So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?"
"Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN..."
"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?"
Got me.
Remember when we were in high school together?
Yeah.
"I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet someone, fall in love- and that'd be it?..Ross?"
"Yes, yes!"
"Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.."
Me either...
Hey! What do you guys think about this. Ross. The Divorce-Force.
Better.
Very cool.
Hey Phoebs...You know I'm I'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
"Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah...No, thanks you."
"Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realized I don't think marriage is necessarily the right path for you."
What do you mean?
"Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but...is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?"
They are awfully boxy.
I don't know...you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so...normal.
Uh huh.
Hello.
It's Erica.
"Ah, the stalker."
"Never mind, it's open."
"Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon."
Let's get out of here.
Hey!
"Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!"
But…
"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!"""
"Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today."
Why not?!
Because I’m dumping him today.
What?! You said he was sweet!
"He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time. ""So did-did you get home from work okay?"" ""Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"""
Just don’t pick up your phone.
"Then he comes over! ""I’m so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!"
What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?
"You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself."
"Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week."
"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!"
"Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!"
Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
What do you mean?
"Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!"
I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
"All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first!"
Hey.
"Oh, hi."
Here. I thought you might be cold.
Thank you.
"Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well."
"Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better."
Do you?
"No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang ""Su-Su-Suicide"", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, ""Smelly Cat"", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat."
"Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!"
"It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money."
"Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for ""Smelly Cat""."
Really? From who?
"Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite."
"Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency."
Yeah. Here you go.
"Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!"
"Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question."
"Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel."
"Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on."
"Oh my God, what happened?"
"Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died."
I can't believe this.
"I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today."
"Well, ya know, someone should have called me."
"I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture."
Zoo dollars?
"Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died."
Woooo hoooo!!!
"Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'"
"Why, what happened?"
"Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part."
What is the worse part?
I can't remember which sister.
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
"Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead."
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
How can you not know which one?
I mean that's unbelievable.
"I mean, was it Gina?"
Which one is Gina?
"Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings."
"No, no, no, that's Dina."
"You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!"
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
"Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat."
That was me.
"Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry."
That's okay.
That's all right.
That's okay.
So Rach.
Yeah.
Where is Emma?
"Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix."
"Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!"
"Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?"
"Yes, we are."
"Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?"
How's that?
"You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go."
Who in God's name are you?
"Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!"
Give me your phone.
Here.
And now your cell.
Okay.
This is your cellphone?
Yes.
This is your current cellphone?
"Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time."
"Phoebe, where's your purse?"
"No, no! Give it to me!"
You can't have it.
Give it to me!
No.
I'll go in there.
Oh yeah.
Phoebe come here
Haha!
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?"
"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric. Sorry."
"Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding."
"She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!"
"Oh, what a fun office."
"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?"
Rachel? Do you smoke?
"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke."
…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
That doesn't seem fair.
"I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!"
"Yeah, it is the best."
"I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?"
Ross?
Hey roomies!
Love what you've done with the place.
"Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here."
"Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine."
Oh yeah!
"Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!"
"Hey, all right!"
"Pretty cool, huh?"
"You're fake laughing too, right?"
"Oh, the tears are real."
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
"Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'"
"Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?"
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Just the last two pages.
All right.
I found the picture!
Picture? What picture?
"Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction."
"Okay uh, look I know you’re a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff…"
"Oh, thanks."
But you’re spittin’ all over me man!
Well of course I am!
You know you’ve been spitting on me?!
"That’s what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!"
Wow! Didn’t know that.
Great!
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
Hello.
"Hey, it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I…"
Hello.
"Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m…"
Stop callin’!!
"Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge."
All right!
"What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything…"
"Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this."
"Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps."
"What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool."
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
"Well, what about my stuff?"
You don't have any stuff.
"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?"
No.
"Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room."
Mmmmm.
"Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp."
"Chandler’s knees. Chandler’s… ankles. Chandler’s ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you’re all set."
"Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!"
Yeah! In… really long hour world.
What?
"Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you’re a client, I can’t ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling."
"Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse."
Really?!
"Yeah, really."
Hey guys.
"Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?"
It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
"Ohh, yeah."
"Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?"
Yeah.
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
"No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way."
"Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don’t you set us up?"
"Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?"
"Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!"
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
"Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?"
"I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?"
Do you want me to want you to care?
Do you?
What?
"Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off."
"Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?"
I've got no reason to stay.
Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
"I can't believe we go on in, in a week."
"Hey, it's gonna be all right."
"Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?"
What?
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
"Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight."
"Oh, okay."
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.
G'night.
I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
"Oh, well... That had been your window."
"Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible."
Really? The scientist guy?
Really? Chandler?
Continue...
"Oh. Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night."
Phoebe!
"I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!"
"Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?"
"Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am."
What are you gonna do?
"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
You have to tell David!
"Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey."
"Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much."
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Yeah!
"Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two."
"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird."
"Yeah, it is."
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
"No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird."
"Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking."
Who’s the father?
Yeah!
I can’t say.
Why?!
Why not?
I can’t say because he’s famous.
"Oh my God, who is it?!"
"Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us."
"Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby."
As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?
What?! Well he never said that to me!
Howdy doody.
That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
"Oh relax man, relax. You’re looking a little flushed."
"Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question."
What question?
"Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?"
There’s no question.
So you think Ross too?
You picked Ross?!
"Ross is really strong! Okay, he’s the strongest out of all three of you! Except for Joey."
I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.
"Uh, in her defense, she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you."
Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it?
Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!!
"Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! Now listen, no one’s gonna fight in this apartment."
"Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let’s give ‘em what they came for!"
"Hey, you guys could arm wrestle."
Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
You’re going down.
Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown!
"Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing."
"Look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay? It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity! That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!"
That means nothing to me. Come on!
"So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now."
"What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate."
"Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs."
Maybe you could be my roommate!
Well there’s an idea!!
Yeah!
"That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?"
"Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th."
"December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause."
"So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?"
"No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name."
He didn’t ask me to marry him.
Ohh.
Well then definitely don’t take his name.
He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Pete?!
Why?! What is it?
I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.
Oh?!
"Yeah, but without the costumes."
Oh.
Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
Yeah!
Oh then you know each other.
We’re on a semi-first name basis.
What do you think of adding him to our team?
"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes."
Really? They love him down on six.
But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.
"Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put."
I think it’s best sir.
But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
"Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em."
That’s a good one.
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
"It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie."
"Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!"
"I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?"
"Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss."
"I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!"
Why do you care so much?
"Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?"
Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
"Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils..."
"Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!"
"All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean..."
"Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it..."
"Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!"
"Bing!  Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team."
What is with him?
"With him? You’re is favourite, you’re his guy!"
We never get smacked.
"Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once."
"Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me."
"I’m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall."
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
No sir.
There you go.
"Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!"
"Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated."
"Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her."
"All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?"
"Oh God, yeah."
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Okay!
No-no
"Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!"
"Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble."
"Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt."
"Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt."
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
Howdy.
"Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day."
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
"All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?"
Yeah I guess you're right.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
I'm gonna do it.
"We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony."
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Hi.
Hi.
I don’t know why I’m here.
I didn’t ask. You wanna come in?
I don’t know.
"Oh, okay. Well, I’ll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch."
Chandler is such an idiot!
Drink?
"Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…"
…on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Still smoking cigars?
"Uh, no! No! That’s…art! If it bothers you I can put my art out."
"No that’s, that’s okay."
"So Monica let me ask you a question. Y’know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?"
"Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago."
Oh really?
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.
Who is it?
Edward Nevski?
Yeah he’s no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
No.
Ahh.
But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Do you really not know where I’m going with this? It left! It’s one huge room!
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
See?
"Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up."
"You can’t, because of the new skylight!"
There’s a skylight?! Wow!!
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
"Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that."
Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?
"A little bit, yeah."
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
"Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey."
Are you sure?
"Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you."
Oh me too.
"I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?"
"No, I do not hear that."
Hey!
Hey!
I've got good news!
You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
"Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job."
It's great! How?
"Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you."
So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.
"I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?"
No. I can't be away from you for that long.
Really?
"Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year."
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
"Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you."
"Hey, you said that without gagging!"
I know!
Hey you guys.
Hi!
Hey.
"I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!"
Oh!
"Joey. Erica, baby!"
Hi.
"Everyone. Erica, baby!"
"Monica. Calm, self."
"Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!"
"Welcome to New York City! Or should I say ""ghe deu flooff New York City""?"
Why would you say that?
Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
"I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center..."
"Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty."
"Oh yeah, let's do that!"
Great! This baby'd better be really good.
Are they right?
"Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross."
"Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight."
"Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off..."
Although...
I like although!
"I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years..."
Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
"Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now."
Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
No...
I'm thinking about you...
Yeah...
Let's forget about Ross...
Forgotten.
"Hi Dr. Long, how are you?"
"Oh, you’re nice to her."
She has the drugs!
We’ll do a quick check.
Okay.
"So, eight days late huh?"
Yeah.
You must be a little uncomfortable.
"Eh, just a tad."
"You’re about 80 percent effaced, so you’re on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you’re anxious there are a few ways to help things along."
Do them!!
"Actually, they’re things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I’ve found that some of them are quite effective."
"Well, we are ready to try anything."
"Okay, there’s an herbal tea you can drink."
Okay.
"You can take some caster oil, there’s eating spicy foods…"
Great! We will do all of those.
"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?"
Give me a 'for instance'.
"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?"
Marlon-
Marlon?!
"-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl."
...As in Mouse?
As in my grandmother.
"Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?"
Julia..
We agreed on Minnie.
"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?"
"Ucch. Uchh. In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you."
UCHH!
You know... this... this is classic Rachel.
Yeah... yeah right... Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
"This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my career."
What? What career?
Um... I'm a decorator.
Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
Why can't you ever be supportive?
Sup... You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
Oh. Yeah. Well... You didn't come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.
I did the first time! Oh. Oh... And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
Emma.
Oh whose side are you on?  I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responsibility of a child.
How hard could it be? You do it.
ooh oooh...
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
"God, your hair sure is different!"
"Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look."
"So uh, where's Monica?"
"She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving."
"Hi, Chandler."
Oh my God!
"What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?"
"You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!"
Dude!
Sorry!
"Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend."
"Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!"
"So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner."
Dude!
Sorry.
Hello Michael.
Joseph.
"May I have a word with you, please?"
This is... great...
"Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this."
Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
"More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for ""Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."""
"Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?"
"I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her."
"Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her."
"That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family."
That must have been one lousy movie.
That was ME!
Hey!
How was the pediatrician?
"Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good."
You promised you wouldn't say anything.
I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
"Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor."
"Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'"
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
"Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!"
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
So where are we going next?
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
"Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
"Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?"
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
"Yeah, no one talks like that!"
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
"Hey, I'm more cop than you two!"
How do you figure that?
"Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!"
"Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay."
"Umm, jealous!"
"Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here."
"Yeah, no problem."
Ross!
"Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!"
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
"Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?"
"Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?"
Yeah. O-okay.
"""When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and…"" And then I can’t think of a good word for right here."
How about receiving?
Yes!
"See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!"
"Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?"
"No, not us… Us!"
"I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?"
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
It doesn’t say that!
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
"See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories."
"Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, ""Began their beautiful journey…"""
There you go!
"Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?"
"'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting."
"Ok honey, you really need a job."
"Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview."
Really.
"Well, what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice."
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.
You mean like for award shows?
Some of them.
"You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, ""You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"""
"Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?"
"Okay, who wore those?"
"Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw."
Not bad.
This one is uh Paul O’Neil.
Who’s that?
"He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!"
Pierce Brosnan?
Uh-huh.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!
Yeah.
"Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!"
It’s a pretty cool tux.
"Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?"
Hey! Is Ross still here?
"Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake."
"Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village."
"Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn’t even watch it! Anyway, here. I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself."
Thank you. What? You don’t want to see this do you?
Hell yeah!!!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
"Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail."
Chandler!
"Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that."
You're a dork.
"Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!"
"Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me."
"Ok, great!"
"Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!"
I didn't say anything yet!
"Well, get back in there and talk!"
I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
What!?
"Well, some things are just hard to say to your face."
"Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!"
Ooh! We have a problem.
Oh! What are we gonna do?
Just be honest with her.
Oh my God!
And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
Alright! Enough out of you!
Hi!
"Hey! So, how was Atlantic City?"
Good.
Yeah?
I brought you back a present.
"Wha—? Oh, come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?! Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it’s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That’s not interesting."
I think it’s interesting.
I do too! I missed you!
"I missed you, too! So, how was your week?"
"Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!"
How exciting!
Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.
Oh no.
"Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me."
Yeah right!
What?
"Joey cracks me up! It’s like, ‘Yeah, why don’t you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn’t be awkward at all!’"
Huh…uh-huh.
"Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant!"
"So, what’d you tell him?"
Just a second!
"Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler."
Not at these prices.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
"Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy."
"Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends."
"Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you."
"In a moment, please, I’m in the middle of a task. And you have a customer."
Hi!
"Hi, I’m Joshua."
"Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?"
"Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife…"
"Oh, I’m so sorry."
"Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt."
"Well, at least that’s a great suit."
"Yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you’re willing, I’m all yours."
Okay.
"Rachel, you needed to speak to me?"
"No-no, that wasn’t me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry."
Hey guys.
Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
"No, thank you."
"All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house."
"Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city."
"But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map."
"Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us."
"You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!"
Damn it.
See you guys later.
Okay!
I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Good for you. That was really mature.
"What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here."
Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.
Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr!
You really want to take me?
"Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back."
So you’re never actually going to pay me back?
"Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!"
"It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself."
I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.
Thanks. That means a lot to me.
"Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress."
Hey guys!
Hey!
"Hey, Missy..."
"You know, our band is playing on Friday."
"Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called ""Way! No Way!""."
No way!
Way!
Right. I'll be there.
Fresh!
Boss!
Mint!
She's gone.
"I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out."
"Dude, I was gonna ask her out."
"I said it first, bro."
"Well, I thought it first, Holmes."
"Look, if you did..."
"Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want."
Totally. I had sex in High school...
Me too. I'm good at it.
"All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg."
You got it.
"All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with."
Those are the pacts!
"Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway."
"Oh, oh... maybe not you!"
"Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?"
Oh.
Oh.
"No-no-no! No, no, no, we’re not married."
"We are having a baby together, but we’re not involved. I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. Or, yes stranger, we’d like this delivered please."
Why don’t you fill out this address card.
"Oh, okay."
I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
"Oh yeah! Actually, that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a couple."
"I chose those, I’m a paleontologist."
Really?! That is so cool!
"Oh. Oh yeah, don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he’s a doctor, but he’s not."
"Oh no-no, I’m fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?"
Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
"Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I’m bored."
"Oh, I love your neighborhood. There’s a great gym right around the corner from your building."
That’s my gym.
"I can tell you work out. A paleontologist who works out, you’re like Indiana Jones."
I am like Indiana Jones.
Here you are.
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
I went through this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Every time?
Uhuh.
"Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this."
"All right, I trust you."
"Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why..."
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
"Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York."
"Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow."
"Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy."
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
"Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change."
"Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?"
"No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay."
"So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?"
Hi!
Hi.
"Sorry about that, but I couldn’t get that lock to work on the door."
"Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in."
"You must be Rachel, I’m Erin."
Hi.
"Hi. I don’t mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?"
Would you like some pancakes?
I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?
"Oh! It’s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are."
"Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks."
"All right, don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?"
An hour.
I can’t help you.
Phoebe!
"All right, all right, we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. ""Hi! Come on in, I’m uh, Regina Philange."""
Chandler Bing.
"Bing, what an unusual name."
"Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. I’ll let myself out."
"All right, I'll see you guys later."
Off to see young Ethan?
Thank you.
How young is young Ethan? Young?
He's... our age.
When we were?
"Okay, he's a senior in college."
College?
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
"No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22."
What?
"Oh, I can't pass for 22?"
"Well, maybe 25-26."
I am 26.
There you go.
"Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?"
"Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
What?
Could tonight be the Night?
"I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things."
"So, did you shave your legs?"
Yeah.
A-ha!
"Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?"
"No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade."
"All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?"
Done!
Let me finish.
Oh.
"I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all."
"Ooh, we could end up with nothing."
Or you could end up with everything.
"Ooh, I like that."
"All right, so what do you say?"
No!
"Oh, just do it!!"
"Op, op, I’m convinced!"
"Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best friend."
"All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in."
All right!
Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
I was her accountant four years ago.
Ohhhh!
I’m very interested to find out who’s been doing her taxes these last four years.
That’s great!
"So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?"
I don’t know.
Excuse us for a minute. You didn’t tell her to come?!
You were supposed to tell her!
No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
"Fine, I’ll go call her."
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
"So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?"
"Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia."
"You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you."
"Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?"
"You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?"
"Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special."
"Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it."
"Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it."
Hi.. how was the game?
Well..
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Alan.
"He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-..."
"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team."
"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.."
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
What?
"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
"That’s her! Okay, come on!"
Hi!
Hi.
So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
"Uh, that-that’s-that’s me!"
That’s me.
"Joey Tribbiani, a big fan."
So is that a bedroom?
"Yeah, yeah right over there."
"All right, whenever you’re ready."
That was weird.
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
I’m waiting.
So she’s a…
"Yeah, that’s one naked hooker!"
I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
"Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!"
You’re a little high maintenance.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
"I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you."
I didn’t even tell him to say that.  All right you’re off my list.
I’m off the list.
"Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend."
"Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive."
Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
"Wait, you can't take the money out."
I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
"But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor."
I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
"Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…"
"Bite me, blondie!"
"Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just…"
"Sorry I'm late, but I left late."
Okay.
"So Pheebs, what is the book about?"
I thought you said you read it in high school.
"Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?"
"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism."
"How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here, Rachel Green?"
"Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story."
"Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?"
"Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character."
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here…
You completely stole my answer!
"Well, honey that was pretty obvious."
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers."
Would ya care to venture one?
Would you care to venture one?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
"All right, let's move on."
Okay then.
Hey!
Hey!
"Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away."
"Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
"Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way."
"Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person."
"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!  And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?"
You get the dollhouse.
I get the dollhouse!
"Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel."
"Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?"
"No, just a barrel."
"Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse."
Really?! Really?!
"Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with."
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
"Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger."
Hey everybody.
Hi Roger.
"So umm, I’m gonna get us some drinks. Would you help me out?"
Yeah.
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
"No, she's at a faculty meeting."
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but…"
Come in.
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum."
What's it look like?
Kinda like a big face without skin.
"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it."
"Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, ""Dear Rach, you’re such a good person."" Not girl! Person!"
"Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it."
"""Dear Rach, you’re a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."""
"Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!"
Yes!
Could you also tell them I’m skinny now?
Oh! Me too!
Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
That’s not totally true.
What?
What?
"Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian."
How did you know that?!!!!
It’s true?!!
No.
Wanna make it more interesting?
How much were you thinking?
Ten bucks a game?
Make it fifty!
I'll make it a hundred!
One thousand...
OK!
"To see who goes first, you got a quarter?"
No... Either of you girls got a quarter?
"Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!"
"Monica, you call it."
"Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!"
Tails!
"Ow, what are the chances!"
Ha! My point!
"Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point."
He was a lawyer!
"So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?"
"Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg."
"Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there."
"Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg."
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
Bye mommy.
We love you. Bye.
"Have a good time. Ok, Ben."
"And to you too, Helen."
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
"Oh, okay. Send her in."
Hi.
"Hi, Nina. Come on in."
You wanted to see me?
"Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and little thing, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers."
"Which is bad, because?"
"Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack."
Your... excuse me?
WENUS.  Weekly Estimated Net...
"Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won’t happen again. I wouldn’t want to do anything to hurt your... ""wenus."""
So uh - I guess we should - make it official huh?
Uh - Look Rach - Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
Hey Joey. Hey you.
Hey you.
"Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I'm really more of a candy guy."
"You're weird today. Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something."
"Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too."
"Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?"
No.
What?
"Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no."
"Ross, thank God."
"Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?"
I ate a bug.
"Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck."
"Oh, now you want a favour?"
"Yes, please."
"Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?"
"Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends."
"No, I'm not gonna pick them up."
"Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car."
"No, Rachel doesn't want me to...."
"Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you."
"Yeah, you're right."
Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
"We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you."
You slept with another woman?
"Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk."
"Hey, look at this! They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight."
"Umm, that paper’s two weeks old."
"All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it."
"Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y’know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great."
Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.
"Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung."
"Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas."
"Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?"
"Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?"
"Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy."
"Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs."
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
"Hi, Phoe."
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
"Oh, just updating the phonebook."
"Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?"
"Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?"
"Just, you know, to see... um."
"Oh, sure, yeah. his is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation."
"OK, is this really my father?"
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
"OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire."
"Look, I. . ."
"Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me."
"Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame."
Oh God.
"It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder."
"Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?"
"Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate."
"OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?"
Honey.
Oh.
"Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him."
Oh.
"Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information."
Aww!
You ok?
"No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! Oh my God! I can't play!"
So you forfeit?
Mike wins?
I can't believe it! I lost!
"No, you didn't."
What?
Because I'm gonna play for ya.
You can't do that!
"Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat."
"Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister."
"Honey, you don't have to do this."
"Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you."
But... you suck!
"You're welcome, sweetheart."
"All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins."
Ok!
Oh my God! You're good!
It's like watching porn!
And that's... how... it's done!
Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you. Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!"
Why?
I don't know.
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
That's why!
"Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad."
"If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so."
"Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?"
"Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?"
"OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that.  Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . .  wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there."
You know what the. . .
"I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . ."
"So, um, what do you do for a living?"
"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major."
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
I guess.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine."
"Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin.....does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
An advance?
"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
"Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful."
"Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that."
"Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger."
: Hey.
: What are you doing?
Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry. It’s a little old but…
: No! You’re clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.
": Oh yeah, of course you don’t!"
No.
": ‘Cause you’re a little princess! ""Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me…"""
I didn’t… I never said that.
": You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don’t think of someone else for a change?"
"Okay, I’m sorry."
"Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!"
"Rach, he’s a friend of ours."
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.
"Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!"
He’s coming over! He’s coming over!
Joey!
"I know, here-here!!"
"Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together."
Hi!
Hi!
"Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you…"
"Well, it’s always nice to meet the fans."
Ah!
She’s not crazy is she?
No.
"So uh, how you doin’?"
Hey you guys.
Hey Joe what’s up?
"I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like…"
I can see why that’s hard to resist.
I like her so much!
"Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way."
I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
"You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?"
"I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!"
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
That's so sweet. Find anything?
Slim Pickings.
"Nothing, huh?"
"No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite."
'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
"Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something."
Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
"Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'"
"All right, he's crowning. Here he comes."
"Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?"
Not.... helping!
"You're doing great, you're doing fine."
"Hello! Oh, sorry."
What do you see? What do you see?
"We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person."
"Oh, look at that."
What does he look like?
"Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o."
Really?
"You guys, he's beautiful!"
"Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
"All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!"
Sorry! I'm just—I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
But we're not ready to tell yet!
I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Hi!
"Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!"
"Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say."
"Oh, okay."
"I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now."
Wow! Umm....
"Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back."
Oh my…God! Let me see that!
You fall for it every time!
Hey!
Hi!
I brought you my old maternity clothes!
"Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet——Ooh, those are so cute!"
"Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the baby’s born, they’re great for shoplifting melons."
"No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!"
Normal.
"Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag."
Nope! That never happened to me!
"Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?"
Nope.
"All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!"
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
When I was six years old.
Hm-mmm.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
"That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go."
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Oh!
"Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?"
Tribbiani.
"Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone."
"Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends.  Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?"
She's not much of a phone person.
"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
"Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no."
"Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
Maybe you should.
"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?"
May I help you?
Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
"Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated."
"Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one."
"Well, this is very generous!"
And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
"Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter."
Not necessary.
Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
"And ""X"" is spelled uhm... ""Mike Hannigan""."
"Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much."
"Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!"
It does. It feels really good!
"Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!"
"Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym."
Mhm... it's moist.
"I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage."
How to make the next one even shorter?
"Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me. Maybe I have to pee again."
"Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?"
"Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…"
Are you yelling at me?!
God no!
"Y’know what daddy? If you don’t like Ross, that’s fine. It doesn’t matter to me, I’m gonna go out with him anyway."
Really?!
"Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me! Still not yelling!"
Wow. What can I say? This doesn’t make me like you any better!
"That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either."
Then we agree?
"Uh yeah, I guess—Yeah! I guess so."
Neither of us like Ross!
I like Ross.
Ohhh! Kids!
"Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!"
"That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now."
Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!
Professor Geller?
"Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?"
"I know I didn’t do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade."
And why exactly would I do that?
Because I’m in love with you.
What?!
"Yeah, I’m all…in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?"
No!
Well why not you changed Ned’s grade!
"Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!"
No he’s not! He’s totally yanking your chain! He’s done this with three other teachers!
What?
He’s got a girlfriend!
I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.
I know! It’s awful. I love you.
"Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs."
No problem! Next week: stealing...
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Yeah.
"Can-can I get your autograph, I’m your biggest fan."
Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
"Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you’re really talented."
"You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He’s a fan. Bye!"
"So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?"
"See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?"
We have got to move!
"I knew it!! Y’know, you’re not so quiet yourself, missy!"
"And I’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, ""Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."""
"Y’know, I know you’re talking, but all I hear is, ""Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."""
All right! You and me! Let’s go! Right now!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Y’know I think you can take her.
You’d better hope I don’t see you in the hallway!!
"All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can’t treat them that way."
"They said stuff to me too, y’know!"
"I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t work. It can’t. I’m very upset."
"Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?"
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
What did I tell you about the hall?!
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I’d really like it if we could be friends.
"Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too."
Great.
"Now come on. Well, I’m glad we worked things out."
Me too.
Okay.
I’ll see you.
Bye.
Or I’ll hear you.
That’s it big girl! Come on!
Wait!
You’d better run!
"Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?"
I thought he was with you.
"He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek."
"You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating."
"You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad."
"Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress."
"As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress."
"But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then."
"Honey, it isn’t good luck."
"Pheebs, how’s it going?"
I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking too fast?
"Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler."
"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.  Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too."
"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies."
See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
What do you mean?
"I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around…"
"That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping."
"Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone."
Hey!
"Hey, how'd it go?"
"Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow--the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!"
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
"Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff.  Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!"
"I'll have one, please. Plus my money."
Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.
"Honey, I’m going to put my hand in your pocket!"
No?
No.
I’ve been taking dancing lessons.
What?!
"Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget."
Oh that is so sweet!
So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
Yes.
"I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!"
Rachel has a new doll.
"Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh."
"Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I’m-I’m saving this for my friend Ross."
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? Wow! I didn’t know he had a nickname.
"Oh, he won’t sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here."
"Well, how-how come?"
That’s just the way it is.
That’s crazy.
"Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now…Peter! Hey, Peter! It’s me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin’ which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don’t even hear me!"
"I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you. Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat."
"That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey."
"Hello, Mr. Heckles."
You're doing it again.
We're not doing anything.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
You don't have birds.
I could have birds.
"Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down."
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
"All right, bye-bye."
Bona sera.
"Oh, hi sweetie."
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Last night.
"Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew."
Hey hey hey! She's on!
Ah! Nora Bing!
"Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you."
"You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters...."
What?
"One more chance Ursula, please?"
"Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward."
Wh..
"Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously."
"Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!"
"Oh, you're not a dingus."
"I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones."
"Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay."
Well thanks.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You built a fort didn't ya?
Kinda.
"Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was."
"Dude, you should've gone out once and a while."
I hate this thing!
"Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!"
"Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?"
"Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents."
"Come on baby, come on!"
"'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'"
Very nice touch.
"'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel."
Unbelievable.
Thank you so much.
"It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before."
"You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in."
"Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time."
"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
Two?
"Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you."
"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right"
"Nooo, four."
"Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!"
"Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one."
"Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax."
"No way, forget it."
"C'mon, she's your mom!"
"Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?"
"Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!"
"Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
"C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast."
You can say that because she's not your mom.
"Oh, please..."
"Oohh, I love it!"
Really? You're not gonna return it?
"Well, not this second!"
"Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!"
"Oh wow, it's so beautiful..."
"Wow, it really is!"
"""Wendy"" is a fat girl name."
Aren't we done with that?
"Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?"
Hey!
Oh my god...
"Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!"
What are you doing here?
I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
"Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?"
Monica.
Got ya.
I never want to leave you again!
"But I thought if you left, you get fired."
Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
What?
"What, you, you really quit your job?"
"Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he really wants to do?"
What do you really want to do?
I have not thought this through!
Oh my god!
"I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it."
"No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!"
Thanks!
"Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined."
Ahh...
Now give me my real gift.
Thank you.
"Here, pass these, will ya.."
"Oh, hey..."
"""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet."" -- How did you know?"
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
"I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys."
Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
I don't have a job!
"Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow."
"No! No! No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know, started thinking about you and David and I…remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just… Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?"
No I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never…I may never see him again.
"Hey, y’know you could always visit him."
"Oh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport."
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
"Well—But—Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back."
I can give it a shot.
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
"See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss."
"What song was that, Pheebs?"
"Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za."
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
"Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?"
Mmh-mmh.
Can you say Barbados?
Barbados!
"Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars."
Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
"Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff""."
I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
"Oh, right, because he's a scientist!"
"No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die."
"Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow."
"Okay, this one I like!"
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!"
"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?"
"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
Do not speak ill of the dead.
"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?"
"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom."
What did you say?
"I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn."""
"Uh, may I help you?"
"Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed."
"Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller."
"All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
Nobody sees the king!
"Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king."
Hey! You can't go back there!
Oh my God.
Hey you guys I got some bad news.
"Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try, ""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"""
"No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. I didn’t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find."
"Man, this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. ""Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."""
Hey!
Hey.
Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Umm…
Oh dear God!
"But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know."
What about the rest of Manhattan?!
"Yeah, they all know."
"Oh my God, this is horrible!"
I’m so sorry.
I’m so humiliated!
"Yeah but y’know what they say Mon, ""There’s no such thing as bad press."""
"You don’t think that umm, ""The chef’s Mahi Mahi was awful awful,"" is bad press?"
I didn’t write it.
Is he right? Am I really—Am I awful?
No!
"Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I’m not just saying this because I’m your friend, I’m sayin’ it ‘cause it’s the truth. You’re food is abysmal!"
How could you have told her?
"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
"Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?"
"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
"Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff."
"That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'."
Were both of those Joey?
"Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her."
Not even with your best friend.
Noo!
Hi.
Hey!
"Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!"
"Well, it’s nice to know that you…"
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
"That uh, that is my roommate Rachel."
Oh that explains all the women’s underwear.
Sure. Yep.
"Oh my God! It’s true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?"
Certainly.
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
"I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore."
"God. You seem really, really nice."
"Okay, bye-bye."
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
"All right, here we go."
Okay.
"Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute!  Umm, you’re a stupid bitch."
I really can’t slap you.
You are so beautiful.
Nice to meet you! My God you’re great!
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I…
You got married again.
Yes.
So that’s your second marriage in two years.
"Yes, second in two years. Third overall."
"Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don’t you tell me what happened."
"Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…"
"I’m sorry, is this the same Rachel who’s name you said at the altar in the second marriage?"
"Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her."
"Oh, that’s better then."
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
I think just the annulment for today.
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Easy.
"And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind."
No problem.
And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
"Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
"Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there."
"Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy."
Hello? Hello?
I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
"Honey, you're screaming."
YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
"Oh, that's great."
"Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean."
Awesome.
"Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met."
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Where?
"Our place, the hall! I..."
I got something for her. It's a book!
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
"No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?"
"You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?"
"No, it came out to an even twenty."
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Hey Joey!
Hey!
Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you will never get back to Chandler.
I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself...Chandler is my best friend...It would be wrong. Good....But wrong.
Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
Awww...I don't know Monica...You know...erm...lending friends money is always a mistake.
But Chandler lent you money!
And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Come on...I just need it for some rent and...and some other bills.
Oh...how much?
Two thousand dollars?
Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Yeah.
That's right I am!
"You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you."
Why?
"Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this."
"You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here."
Get a room!
"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?"
"I don't know, probably just invest it."
Ooh! Calm down ...
"Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, did I say ""invest it""? I meant ""be cool and piss it all away""."
"Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!"
I don't really care about the Knicks.
"Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward."
You would do that? I never get picked!
"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go."
You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
"You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds."
"Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?"
I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?
"Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy"" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ..."
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
"Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""Daddy"" too."
"Oooh, I like that, ""daddy""."
I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
"Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?"
Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. no I can't.
Hey!
It's almost our anniversary!
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Huh.
"Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?"
There’s a side of steamed vegetables.
"Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?"
"Y’know what? Bring her both, and I’ll have the same."
"Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almost forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check."
"Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We’re on a date."
Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
"No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don’t like me for—I’m sorry I couldn’t even get through that."
I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
"Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan."
Oh my God. And that works?!
"Well it does when you combine it with, ""This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"""
"Oh, you poor little famous man."
"Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can."
"Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!"
"Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves."
Alright. So where’d you grow up?
"That’s your move? Boy Rach, you’re lucky you’re hot."
"Come on, just answer the question!"
Queens.
And so were-were you close to your parents?
"Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad."
Why not?
"I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is."
Oh. It’s gotta be rough.
"Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!"
Huh?
"""Where’d you grow up,"" it’s so simple!"
"Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room."
Yeah.
And now you’re watching me walk away.
Yes I am! Again so simple!
Hey sweetie.
"Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?"
I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.
Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Awww. But still no.
"No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you."
"Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?"
"Oh no-no, I can’t do that."
"If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said."
Okay.
Okay.
"So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy."
Oh my God. He threw up?
"No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe’s secret?"
"Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired."
That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
That’s right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
Hey.
Hi.
"So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?"
About what?
"Y'know, about what happened with us."
"Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?"
"What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress."
"Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?"
Nooo.
"Hi, Kate!"
"Hi, Lauren."
"Hi, Lauren."
"Hi, pig!"
"Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her."
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
"Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!"
"Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it… Her initials…"
Ohh.
"Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller."
"Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase."
Who cares? He works in a museum!
"Mornin’ Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled."
"Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?"
"Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?"
What about my cab?
I don’t need that anymore.
"No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back."
"I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?"
"I don’t know, it’s such a long trip."
"It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship."
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Sure?
"All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped loving you."
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
"That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths."
"Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane."
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
"In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week."
"I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day!"" And it starts right now!"
"All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar."
Ohh.
Really?! How come?
"Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true."
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Really? Who-who have you taught?
"Well, I taught me and I love me."
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
"Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about."
"Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less."
I don't gossip!
How come we have one extra place setting?
'Cause you invited your assistant.
"Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her."
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
"Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things."
"Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do."
"Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that."
Done! With time a-to-spare.
Oooh that may be a New World's record
"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm?"
"Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states."
What? That's impossible.
"46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?"
Hi!
Hey.
"Hey—Ooh, how’s Hilda? Is she working out?"
"Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes."
Was she happy you gave her the job?
"Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant."
"Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It’s the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week’s script. Canceled?! Like they’re taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We’re not even shootin’ them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!"
Sorry.
I’m sorry Joey.
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
"Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41."
"Ok, look! Enough is enough!"
"No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!"
"Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!"
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
But...
"Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!"
What about the obsessive cleaning?
That's just good sense!
You didn’t get the annulment?!!
I know.
Ross?!
"Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, ""Three divorces. Three divorces!"" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Geller, Three Divorces."
"Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive."
"Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!"
"So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op, woman! Sorry."
"Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?"
"Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!"
"Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!"
Hey Rach!
What was that?!
"Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?"
I haven’t seen it yet!
Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Guys? I’ve got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
"Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?"
"Yeah, check out the ring."
Oh my God!!
So you two are really serious?!
"Yep, pretty much."
You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean… We’re gonna be brothers-in-law!
"And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again!"
Heyyyy—What?
"Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!"
"Okay! I was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was official y’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best friends."
I think I’m gonna cry!
Pheebs?
Huh?
Where's your bed?
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
What?
"Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore."
What are you talking about?
"I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!"
Everybody knows!
"That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions."
"Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
"Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side."
What?!?!
"Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill."
You can spill. In the sink.
"Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening."
"I love you, too."
"Aww, good. What?"
What? I'm just said.
"No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is."
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Kori? Kori Weston?
Yeah...
Wow! You look amazing!
And you are...
"Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all."
You are married though.
"Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!"
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
"But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!"
"You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!"
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
"No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. Monica?"
"Sorry I’m late, what’s up?"
"Oh hi! Y’know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front."
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn’t go in. How strong am I?
"That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university."
Yeah.
"Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re gonna go out?"
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
"I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you guys."
No! I mean he’s nice.
Yeah.
"He’s the kind of guy you’re friends with, y’know? But he’s not the kind of guy you date. He’s the kind of guy you’d date because you did. Me, not so much."
"Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?"
"Oh no-no-no, he’s just I don’t know, he’s just a little bookish."
Are-are you saying he’s a geek?
You think so too?
"No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!"
"Fine, then let’s just say he’s not my type."
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
"Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I’ll ask him out."
"Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant."
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
"Oh, please, we're happy to help."
We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
"So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?"
"I mean, you have a lovely home."
"Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us."
"Well, actually, I think this might help."
It's pretty much all the information you need.
Oh my god!
"Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back."
Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
"I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us."
That's great. Can I see the book?
"You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?"
It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
"The bathroom is down the hall, to your left."
I would have told him to do it too.
Can I adopt you?
Hey Ross!
Hey!
"Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!"
What? Oh!
Sorry man.
Here's your scone.
"Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!"
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
"Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?"
"Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that."
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Anybody gonna eat that?
Can any of you watch Emma?
"No, sorry sweety."
"No, I've got work and then I'm proposing.."
"Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?"
"Well, I can do it."
"Well, actually..."
"Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?"
Yeah.
"Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child."
Why not?
"Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!"
"Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!"
"Fine, we'll call the next one Ella."
Wha... the next one?
"Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby."
"Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!"
I... I don't know..
"Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?"
Rach?
I’ll be out in a second.
Oh. It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in…
"Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00."
…in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
"Okay honey, you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta go."
"Please, don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!!"
"Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah."
Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut. Hi!
Hi!
I’m Monica Geller. Who do you know the bride and groom?
"Oh, I used to work with Frannie."
Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers."
"So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?"
We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
"Okay, you’re fine."
"Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview."
I thought it went very well.
"No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you… I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you."
"Rachel, please, don’t make a scene."
There’s nobody here!
"Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you’re making Sophie uncomfortable!"
She’s not making me uncomfortable.
Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
Do you want me to quit?
What?! What would make you think that?
"Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day!"
"Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it’s drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn’t want to lose a perfectly good assistant."
What?
That’s why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking…
My drinking?
"Oh, I must’ve said that after you left."
Said what? Exactly.
That you enjoyed the occasional drink…ing binge.
"Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!"
"Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it! I don’t want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I’ll make you an assistant buyer in this department."
Say more things like that.
"You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow."
I’d need an expense account.
Done!
And an assistant.
"Sophie, get in here!"
Hey!
Hey!
"So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?"
"Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three."
"Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three."
Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.
What happened?
"Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me."
Noo. Why?
"Well, apparently he scares easy."
"Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry."
"It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would."
Come here.
Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
"Hey Chandler, why so fancy?"
"Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring."
"Wait, I think I know someone who does that."
"Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m little nervous."
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.
"Yeah, just don’t get your hopes up."
Why not?
"Well, the interview…"
What about it?
Y’know! You don’t make a very good first impression.
What?!
Oh you don’t know.
Are you serious?!
"Yes, when I first met you, you were like, ""Blah, blah, blah."" I was like, shhh!"
What is it that I do?
"Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always making jokes, y’know, you just—You come off a little needy."
Did you like me when we first met?
"Chandler, I’m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you."
"Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute."
"Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?"
"Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there."
"Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?"
"Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke."
"No, I think you should tell them."
"No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything."
"I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'"
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
Happy birthday dad.
Oh thank you.
Hi ma.
Happy birthday.
"Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?"
"Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us."
"So, here’s somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?"
He cut off his ear.
And?
I’m out.
He painted that.
Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
"Let’s see, ahhh… Where does the Pope live?"
"In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer."
"Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?"
Spock’s birth control.
You need these books.
Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
"Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?"
"How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters."
Hi Joey's sisters!
Hey!
Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.
"Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice."
"No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband."
"Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you."
"Okay, here’s your milk. What do you want to talk about?"
What? What? What?
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I’m sorry. Here.
"Hey, how'd the interview go?"
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
So don't do it.
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
"Monica, relax, go get a beer."
I don't want a beer.
Who said it was for you?
Here goes...
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
"Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out."
Oh...
"Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel..."
YOU! You feel!
I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
"Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best."
"Oh, damn you Geller!"
"Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings."
"No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future."
"No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue."
What is it...? Please...?
"You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you."
"That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?"
Why... I... I don't know. Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
hmmm...
"I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now."
Huh ha ha!
"I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive."
That must have been hard.
"It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... ""What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?"
But you are a real boy!
"I know I am! ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?"
It's All right! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
Here come some more...
"So, according to your bio, you’ve done quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives. Anything you’re particularly proud of?"
"Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one."
"Okay, how about when you’re not working. What do you do in your spare time?"
"In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I’m also a mento for the kids. Y’know a mento, a role model."
A mento…
Right.
Like the candy?
"Matter of fact, I do."
"Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?"
"Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise."
OK what's up
"OK, umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the sand and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?"
Oh yeah.
"OK, you know that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?"
What? Who says that?
People who've never ever been to Paris.
What's going on?
We're moving to Tulsa!
Excuse me?
"OK, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes."
Tulsa Oklahoma!
"The sooner state, whatever that is."
"Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!"
"Really, oh what a beautiful morning staring with a fringe on top."
"Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?"
"No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. I'll get out of it."
Thank you.
"So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes."
Yes!
Ooh-ohh!
Great!
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Why?
What?! You can't—what did you tell her?
"I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!"
"Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends."
"Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife."
Yeah.
That's true!
"Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life."
That's true!
"No, you cannot."
"Thanks for the help, problem solved."
"Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today."
"You do, huh?"
"Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone…"
What are you talking about?
I'm not sure.
Y’know what? Why don’t you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
We really…didn’t get a chance to…
You have got to be kidding me!
We didn’t get anything for anyone.
Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
That you can have.
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
Y’know who has a great video camera?
Greg and Jenny?
Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em.
Let’s call ‘em.
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
"Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!"
Who the hell was that?!
Dr. Wiener.
"Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning."
"Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!"
Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
"Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!"
"Well, what was it?"
Hiccups.
"Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up."
"Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?"
"Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead."
Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
"Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well."
"What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot."
"You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!"
"Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!"
Rachel!!!
Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
I am not gonna answer that!
"Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?"
"No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them."
Chandler?
"Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a wonderful time!"
"Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!"
I know!
I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
"Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose."
"I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much."
Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
Huh. Huh.
"All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan."
"Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before."
"So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?"
"Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible."
How do you do that?
"Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm."
Oh my God!
"Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go."
"No, I don’t want to tell you."
Why not?
Because it’s embarrassing.
"More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!"
"Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when we’re at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, ""Hmmm."" Okay, I know it doesn’t sound like anything, but I swear it works."
"Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…"
"All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time."
Oh. Yeah. Me to.
Hey.
Hey.
Why are you wearing my apron?
"I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour."
"Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as ""my wife"" and ""the woman who's carrying my child""? No? Divorce?"
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
"Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office."
Why don’t we do a trial run.
"Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?"
I’m the supply manager.
"Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs."
We don’t need any toner.
"Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you’re right, this is easy."
"Okay, what was wrong with that call?"
"Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude."
"They’re always going to tell you they don’t need toner, but that’s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script."
Oh.
"So, I think you’re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?"
"No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?"
Hey.
Hey.
"Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were."
What are you doing?
"Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class."
"What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?"
"This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is."
"Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing."
"This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you."
"Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It’s for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!"
"Right, why do you keep saying that?"
Because it’s our thirtieth birthday.
"Yeah, no we’re not thirty. We’re 31. Okay."
Wait!
"Oh, it’s you."
Yeah. What?!
"Yeah, we’re not thirty, we’re 31."
Nu-uh!
Yea-huh! That’s what is says on my birth certificate.
You have your birth certificate?
"Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died."
Our mom.
Right! Okay.
Do you have my birth certificate?
"No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway."
"Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31."
Yeah.
I just lost a whole year of my life.
Okay.
Your middle name is Pamela?
Yes.
"Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?"
Yes! Phoebe.
That’s my first name.
"Right, okay, then no."
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
"Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say... Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!"
"Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!"
"Well hey...I wanna ask you about Monica's little ""groomy"" joke."
Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is because it's a play on the word roomie.
I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is...Maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together. You're not expecting a proposal...right?
Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
Yeah well...that's the thing. For me it's...as far as it can ever go.
What do you mean?
Look. Phoebe...I...I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.
Oh. Wow.
It's just my first marriage was...you know... such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
"Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't."
"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright."
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
What do you think Pheebs?
"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?"
Yeah.
She died.
You're kidding!
That's terrible!
"Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one."
Oh yeah?
"Yeah, she was just an agent."
Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
"Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge."
"Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?"
"Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else."
What if he reads it in the paper?
"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay."
Hi!
Hey sweetie. Oh good.
Rachel Green.
"Aw—oh, that’s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?"
"Oh, I’ll-I’ll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!"
"Will, high school was-was a long time ago."
Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross: Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.
"Oh my God Monica, who is that?"
That’s Will from high school!
"Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. Oh my God, he’s… Look at the way he’s just staring at me. I think he’s trying to mouth something to me, but I can’t make it out."
Now why don’t we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.
"Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party."
I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here.
Find some! Please! Anything that doesn’t say I-I died tragically in France.
"I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in."
"Okay, well, we brought you some wine."
Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
"Uh, actually, that's.."
"Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!"
"Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little..."
What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
"Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink."
You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
"Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it Thanks for coming."
Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Hi.
I love you!
"Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something..."
Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Hey!
"Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself."
"Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?"
Oh my God! Chandler!
Hey.
"Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say."
All right.
"Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so… Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?"
Oh my God! Joey!
Hell yeah! I’ll marry you!
You can’t marry him!
"Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!"
Phoebe!
Why?! Why can’t she marry me?!
I can and I will!
She’s not pregnant. It’s Rachel. Rachel’s the one who’s pregnant.
Oh my God.
"Hi, I'm here to see Mr. Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing."
Mr. Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
I'm sorry. That's always Mr. Campbell's table.
But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
I know. With Gukki
Sssshhhh!
Rachel?
Hi... I'm on a date...
That's great!
"Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there."
"Well, you got uhm... good energy."
Oh.
Rachel?
"Yes, hi!"
James Campbell...
Hi! Excuse us.
Please...
"Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!"
So... your resumé is quite impressive.
Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.
Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resumé.
Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
"Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?"
What? I-I don't.
You don't?
"No, I-I-I love it there."
"Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?"
What?
That's Hugo Boss?
"So, um, how-how did you guys meet?"
"Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight’s ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class."
And he was my best student.
"Yeah, she was my best teacher."
Ohhh.
"If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?"
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
"Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away."
Hello! Who’s in there?
How ya doin’?
Who in the hell are you?
"I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?"
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
"No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I’m an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I’m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink."
You’re in this picture?
"Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you ‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!"
"Joey, right?"
Yeah.
"Every actor at one time or another—opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won’t even watch himself."
"Oh no-no-no, you don’t understand…"
Listen to me!
"Oh yeah, yeah."
"I don’t know one actor worth his salt that didn’t say at one time or another, ""God, I stink!"" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!"
"Yes sir! Yes sir, I’m-I’m—"
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
"Yeah. Oh, yeah."
"Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!"
She's there?!
"Oh yeah, there-there she is!"
"Yeah, yeah, she's here."
"Ross, take me off speakerphone."
Hi.
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
"Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?"
You obviously can't keep away from her.
"Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with."
"I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time."
"Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me."
You're right.
"So, can you trust me?"
No.
"Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum."
"Ross, how could you let this happen?"
"I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's..."
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Well... not in the same way...
"I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"
"Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here..."
"Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks."
"Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy."
Damnit! Damnit!! Here’s your fifty bucks!
"It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?"
Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Fine! You’re on!
Okay.
"Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp right there."
Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.
She’s in the bathroom.
"Rach, we gotta go."
In a minute!!!
"People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to tell them."
"All right, all right. Let’s go!"
"Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…"
"No, I’m fine."
Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate.
Good God man don’t anger it.
"Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable."
Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.
Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call your own mother that.
I’m actually with her on this one.
"After you, miss Banana Hammock."
"Thank you, mister Bag."
"Oh hey, how are you?"
"Oh hi Rita! Good! Oh, Rita's a massage client."
Oh! Why don't you introduce me?
"Er, Rita, this is my husband."
Oh!
Yeah.
Why don't you tell her my name?
"Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag."
Crap Bag?
"If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap."
Okay. Excuse me...
"Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?"
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
Really?
Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
It's a funny word.
It's a Speedo.
...Oh crap!
What?
Nothing.
Okay.
"I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not supposed to."
Fine.
It’s a humdinger!
Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.
Somebody likes you!
Is it Chandler?
No!
"Well, then tell him to stop staring!"
It’s Joey!
Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.
Is it something you’d be interested in?
"I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have."
"All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice."
Not nice enough.
"Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good."
Good for a scrud.
"Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871."
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
Who's next?
Hi there!
"Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself."
"Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... Diffency."
"Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross."
"Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes."
"Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!"
"Oh, please! Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm... OH MY GOD! Is that Christian Sanders? He's so gorgeous!"
Also so gay!
"Oh, in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!"
"Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!"
"Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!"
"Oh, wish me luck!"
"Ok, not that you need it but good... GOD! Is that Chase Lassiter? He's straight, right?"
"Rach, I gotta say... if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!"
"Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. I'm sorry, good luck!"
Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
Oh my God!
"Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?"
"Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything."
I know!!
"Okay, then get the lobster!"
Hey!
Hi.
Hi!!
"Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?"
"I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing."
"Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes."
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
"I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir."
Hey Joey.
"Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?"
"No, I just thought it was cute."
"Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh…Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s…too girly."
Ohh. Like what?
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We..we can’t have that.
"Joey, it’s Anne Geddes. She’s a famous artist."
"Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here."
"Well, I’m sorry. I just thought I’d try to make the place a little nicer."
"Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can."
Well I just thought…
"I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on…and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?"
It’s a curling iron.
"Ohh, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook..and…smells different."
It’s clean.
"Yeah, well, it feels different."
It’s dry.
"Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels…Also what is with these chips you bought?"
"No no no no, it’s potpourri. You’re supposed to smell it."
Well that’s like summer in a bowl.
"Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us."
"Oh, you and me?"
"Uh, no, Susan and me."
The other us.
Ok.
"We're uh, we're getting married."
"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?"
"Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to."
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Look I just thought that...
"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!"
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Mmm hmmm.
Want us to go?
Uh-huh.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi darling.
"So, what's this."
Some of your old stuff.
"Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym."
"Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?"
"Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them."
"Oh, God forbid."
"Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?"
Sure! Why?
"Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate."
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross."
Nice to meet you.
Hey! So what show are you on?
"Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology."
It's a science.
"Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on ""Days"". And my character has just won the Nobel prize."
"Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or..."
"Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys."
"Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs."
I'd lead with that.
"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back."
So the going for help went well?
"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed."
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Then why are you smoking?
Well it's very unsettling.
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
For what?
What do you think? Today's the big day!
"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there."
Thank you!
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
"C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!"
I warned you...
Where’s Chandler?
"Ah, he can’t make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!"
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.
"Phew, close one."
"Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!"
"Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s the future look like for Dina and Bobby?"
Well…I really have high hopes for my band.
You were right. He is funny.
"Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?"
"Well it’s just me and my pal Rooster, the band’s name is Numb Nuts."
Really?
"Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, that’s not a compliment!"
No Joey! I knew you wouldn’t be supportive!
So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!
Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.
Excuse me?
"One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay."
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
"Maybe! Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!"
"Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, I’m just gonna need some help. And Bobby’s gonna be here the whole time."
"You bet I am! And to answer your earlier question, we’re straight-up gangster rap."
"Look, Rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this on her. Why can’t you do that for me?"
Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!
"And you’re my big brother! I mean, you’re my favorite guy in the whole world. I’m not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you."
"Well I’d be scared of them, but all right."
"Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?"
Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!
"We’re gonna be all right. I mean, even if we’re not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us."
That’s right! By his uncle too!
And by you.
"Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment."
Come here!
No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!
"Please...wait, how did you do that?"
What?
"Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?"
"Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!"
Really?
"Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing."
"Okay, let's go running!"
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Let's run towards them!
OK!
"All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!"
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
And here's little Ben nodding off...
"Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!"
"Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!"
"Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!"
That would be nice.
"Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?"
"No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today."
A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
"Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up."
Where have you been?
"Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?"
"No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet."
"C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news."
"Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it."
Why?
Because they made me.
You were fired? What're you gonna do?
"Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?"
In the bank.
"There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it."
Anything larger back there?
"So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!"
"No plans, huh?"
Not a one.
"Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?"
"Oh, right, right, shut up."
"Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it."
"No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling."
"You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."
"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her."
"No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony."
Tony?
"Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?"
"Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know."
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long."
I know. My arm is killing me.
"No, I meant with the dropper over here."
"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper."
"I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?"
"No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?"
"No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me."
"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
"No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do."
Oh.
"I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?"
I'm a waitress.
"Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'..."
Yeah. Gotcha.
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Ok. That's fine.
"Okay, then what happened?"
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
"Hey Pheebs, what's going on?"
Nothing! This is not over!
No! No! No!
What?!
"I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in… Actually, thanks!"
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it."
Really?
"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now."
"Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff."
"That's okay, Joe."
"All right, let's go Pheebs."
Oh God!
"Oh good you’re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o’clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?"
No.
"He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend."
"Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend."
"No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a long time… Anyway, umm Will’s, Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so I invited him here."
Oh that’s nice.
"Oh, and by the way, he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler."
I just want you to say it once in a while.
"Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty."
"Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?"
I could die.
"Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda."
"Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her."
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Hi!
Hi!
Hi Ben!
Wow! You-you look great!
Thanks!
Okay! Hey Tommy.
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
"Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure."
Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
"Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!"
"Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work."
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
"Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that."
"Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this."
Art lover!
What'd you say?
I said art lover.
Is that supposed to be an insult?
"I don't know, I'm very tired."
"So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday."
That sounds great.
Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
"Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can."
Hi Frank.
"Hi, Mrs. Knight."
"Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?"
"Yeah, but not just that."
"Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less..."
None the less.
"None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want."
"That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good."
"Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say."
"Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go."
"I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? ""Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honored, uh..."" Spit it out, David!"
"Uh, Phoebe, uh... you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!"
"Sure, ok, yeah."
"But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end..."
"Oh my God, Mike!"
"It's David, actually!"
"No, Mike's here."
Hi Mike!
Hi David. Chandler. Monica... Oh!
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Hi Phoebe.
"What are you, what are you doing here?"
I have a question I need to ask you.
I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
"Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this."
"Ok, would you care for my seat as well?"
"Actually yeah, that'll be great."
"That's fair, you've had a long trip."
"Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you."
Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
"Sorry David, but she really has to know this."
"Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops."
"You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring..."
I have a ring.
"I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
"Phoebe, will you marry me?"
No!
Um... Ha ha!
"I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future."
We can have any future you want.
"Ok, I'm gonna take off."
"David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry."
"Just so I know, if I had asked first..."
"Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong."
"Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip!"
Is it ok if I hug you now?
Yes!
BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
"Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that..."
"Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?"
"Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend."
Oh dear God.
"Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers."
She you in the parking lot.
"No, Rach!"
And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
"Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings. See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it through this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen."
Chandler!
"Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!"
"Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed."
"Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep."
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
I was asleep.
"Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?"
Uh.
"Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?"
"Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field."
"So Pheebs, pick one of them."
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
"Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly."
"Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince."
"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
"Well sensitive is important, pick him."
Yeah.
"Oh sure, go with the sissy."
Jason is not a sissy!
"Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler."
"Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?"
That's right. Is it true the reason you're here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
"Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started by taking a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?"
I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
"No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?"
"Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one?"
"Alright, look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not."
That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ...
"Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me."
"I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?"
"I always liked you, Ken."
"Hey, how'd the interview go?"
Oh! It's not good.
"You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think."
"Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren."
That is a bad interview.
"What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?"
"Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said ""Wait a minute! Yes I am."" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true."
Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Hey! I got you a present!!
Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
"I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!"
Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…
I love it! It’s huge!! Let’s open it! Open it!!
It’s a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
Oh my God!
I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
"Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom."
"Oh, okay."
All right.
I kinda like it here.
Do you really like it?
"Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like—Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!"
Oh really? What was your first?
Well I-I really don’t remember the name of it.
Well what did it do?
"Well, you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something."
A vending machine?
Don’t feel bad for me! I won like every time!
Hey.
Hey.
How come you have two?
Well this one's for you.
Get out.
"No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds."
"Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies."
That's what they'll call us.
Hey.
"Heeeeey, where have you been? What happened to you?"
"Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him."
"Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. You have got to get over this Joey thing, OK? I never really wanted to marry Joey, OK?"
OK.
You know what I really really want?
"What, Rach?"
"I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again."
Right
"I mean I got news for you mister, Emma's not easy."
"Well, that's what I'm here for. Want me to get that?"
No its really OK? Monica!
Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
Hey! You’re wearing pants!
That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
It’s 9:30 in the morning!
They got a breakfast buffet.
"Hello. Oh, hey Ross!"
"Ooh, let me talk to him!"
"Oh-oh, my God!"
"Well, can I just…"
"Shh!! Wait, what?"
She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!
Shhh!! Please! What’s he saying?
He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
What? Oh my God!
What? Who the hell is Emily—noooo!!
They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
Ow!
How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
"Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time."
"When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person."
Ross! Come quickly! There’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
"I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!"
"He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard."
I don’t get this! She was horrible!
"Okay, I’m going to go stand over there."
Why do you care so much anyway?
"I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!"
"Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail."
"Oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!!"
Mon?
Mon?
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
"Wait a minute, look."
What?
"Look, look, look."
"What, what, what?"
It's an empty apartment.
Oooh.
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Ahoy!
Hey! How’s the boat?!
Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff.
"Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?"
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
"If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?"
"Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips."
"Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that."
"Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want."
You could?
Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Your own boat?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Any progress?
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
"God Joey, this is taking forever!"
What’s the rush? What?
W-w—I just—it’s that—I have—y’know I have-I have an appointment. And it’s very important.
"Whoa-whoa, what is it?"
Well… It’s a date.
"A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!"
"Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this."
"No, I’m gonna!! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!"
"That—It’s not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he’s very special to me."
"Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!"
She was?
"Well, she graduated from high school!"
"Okay, whatever. Y’know what? I don’t have time have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him!"
Fine!
Yeah!
Fine!
Yeah!
…she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.
Yeah. Why aren’t you with Rachel?
"Are you kidding? Look, we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?"
But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
"Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby."
Right. And with who again?
God. He’s crazy! Why doesn’t he want to be with Rachel?
I know!
"I mean seriously, she’s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn’t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and… I haven’t bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?"
Hello.
"Hey, Pheebs! It’s Joey!"
"Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you."
"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?"
"Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?"
"Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun."
So you’re not homesick yet?
"No, I don’t think so."
"All right, the seven of us miss you."
Who’s seven?
"Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…"
"Ahh, the babies miss me?"
"Ooh, the pizza guy’s here!"
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
"Yeah. But y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered the Joey Special."
Two pizzas?!
"Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later."
"Wait, well, where did you get it from?!"
"Great game, huh?"
"Uhuh, uhuh..."
Why do you keep looking at the screen?
I'm not. I'm praying. Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! Where... where are you going?
Going go to the bathroom.
"Well, I think you should wait."
Why?
"Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients."
"Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask."
Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
That's not very enlightened!
"Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you!"
You’ve spoiled everything! It’s like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
"Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?"
"That-that-that’s all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I’ll be right out here. She’s just fixing her makeup."
I hate you!!
"And, I love you!!"
"Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?"
"That’s true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!"
Arrrghh!!
"Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!"
"You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?"
"Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible."
"Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?"
"I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?"
Ask me what?
"Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?"
"No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no."
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Excuse me?
It's horrible.
"Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?"
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
"Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills."
Here we go again.
"I-I can't handle this, you guys."
"Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name."
"All right Pheebs, your cab's ready."
"All right, let's go!"
You're welcome.
"Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?"
We were on a break!
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
"So, you gettin’ tired?"
Nope! I can do this all day.
Yeah? Me too. Gettin’ a little tired though.
"God, I’m exhausted."
"Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona’s standing right over there. Oh God, she’s talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!"
No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp!
"Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! And I’m dressed as doody."
You’re Spudnik.
"Come on, who are we kidding? I’m doody. Please? She’s watchin’."
Fine. Oh no!
Oh yeah!
Yay! My hero!
You’re a weird lady.
"There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you."
What can we do for you?
"All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to ""the noisy girls in the apartment above mine""."
"Well, what about his family?"
He didn't have any.
"Ok, so let's talk money."
"All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two."
"I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!"
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
"So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall."
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
"Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling."
"Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’s not the reason she’s not inviting me!"
"Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest."
Joan?
"Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!"
"Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got ""and guest?!"""
"Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…"
Not broad backed!
"Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!"
What? I can’t cancel on Joan!
Why not?!
"Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?"
"Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me."
"Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan."
"Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life."
We’ll see.
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Rob Tillman!
"No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross!"
"Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman."
"No, no-no, Ross Geller."
"Ohh, of course Monica’s brother!"
Yeah. Right.
Wow! How are you?!
"Good-good, I’m-I’m married."
Ohh! Me too!
Is-isn’t it the best?
"Oh, it’s the best! So, umm how’s Monica?"
"Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi."
"Ohh, I would love too."
"Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited!"
Ohh! Okay!
Come on!
"Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?"
"No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t…"
Oh yeah? Okay.
Okay.
But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?
"Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let’s go see Monica!"
"Nope, not that one."
Can you go any faster with that?
"Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math."
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
"All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not."
I swear you said you had the keys.
"No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys."
"Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys."
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
"Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it."
"Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love."
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
"Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it."
What?
"I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore."
"Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware."
"What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie."
"Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it."
Well that's how I feel.
Well then maybe you should take it.
Well then maybe I will.
Fine with me.
"Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons."
Hey.
Hey!
How did it go with Erin?
"Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!"
"Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?"
"No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous."
Didn’t you sleep together?
"Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that’s a…"
"Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please don’t get married before I do."
Okay.
Can I help you?
"Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?"
He’s not here right now.
"Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall."
"Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up there."
"Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You’re the other one right?"
uhm... Is everything okay?
"Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this..."
"Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just..."
"No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it."
I uhm... I completely understand.
"Alright, I'm gonna go find them... I just need a... need a before I can... you know. Okay, I see you later."
Okay...
That's the door. He's gone...
And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
"Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!"
No way!
"I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!"
"Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?"
"Um, this?"
Yes.
"Guys, you got your hair cut."
"Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay."
"'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice."
"Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp."
"Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs."
"You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!"
Hey!
Hey.
"Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?"
Yeah! Why?
"Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?"
That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!
"Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here’s Warren’s number."
"Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!"
"Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation."
"Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?"
New York.
The big apple!
"I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here."
"Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody."
"I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer."
"Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?"
Check again please!
"I'm sorry, it's not here."
Not there.
"Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?"
I don't know what to say.
She doesn't know what to say!
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
"Unfortunately the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars."
That's insane!
"Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if... if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves."
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
Great.
Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!
"Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy."
"Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!"
Really?!
"Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there."
"Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!"
It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.
"All right, I’ll see you guys."
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
"I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?"
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Okay.
Hey!
"Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff."
Okay!
"Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore."
Okay.
"Hey Rach, what about this?  Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know, too many memories!"
What the hell is that?
"I don’t know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate."
"Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!"
Something to remember me by!
"Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time."
"But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!"
Are you okay? You’re not blinking.
"I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era."
"Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era."
"An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!"
"Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace."
Okay.
"Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?"
"Um, I'm not."
"Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out."
"No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us."
Really?
"Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this."
"Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday."
"Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head."
Wh-wh-why?!
"Well, because she loves you and because you love her."
"Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!"
"Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica."
"I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?"
"No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different."
"Okay. It's not different at all, is it?"
Not unless different means the same.
"Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, ""This is my brother-in-law Ross."" Not, ""My friend Ross,"" ""brother-in-law Ross."" That’s weird isn’t it?"
"Couldn’t I just say, ""This is Ross?"""
"Sure, do whatever you want."
"Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section…"
Yeah?
Look at this.
"Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!"
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!
I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!
Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Then don't go!
"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture."
"Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!"
"You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room."
"And after that, what could I do except become a chef."
Mmm-Hmm.
"And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant."
Mmm.
"You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk."
Mm-Hmm.
"After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?"
Hmm-Hmm.
I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you a little bit?
Mmm-Unmm.
Come on. I want to know.
"Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm."
Hey!
"Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey."
You told her?!
She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard! How’d it go?
"Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!"
What?
"Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?"
I don’t think I’d care.
Really? Lee Majors is hot!
Hello?
We’re in the bathroom!
Why?
Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!
What are you guys doing in here?
"Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!"
You like Rachel?!
"It’s no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It’s just a crush! It’s going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!"
Mazel tov.
"Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!"
"Honey, cover it up with the boat!"
Hello?
Yes we’re all in here and we would love for you to join us!
"Well hey! What’s going on? Ooh, cool boat——Oh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them?"
"No, I was waiting for you!"
Tell us what?
We’re having a girl.
"Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!"
I’ll…I’ll get you later!
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Betrothed…
…betrothed couple.
Hey.
"Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!"
"Yeah, they’re not coming."
What?!
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.
"Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad."
"Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…"
Oh Joey!
"Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years."
No she hasn’t.
Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?
"Well, what am I going to say?"
"I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them so…"
"Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren’t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!"
"...I feel a little sneezy. And now I- Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?"
"No. No, that's- that's okay."
"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"
That guy's going home with a note!
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Could you speak up please?
"Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought"
Daryl Hannah.
"Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a"
Hard quality.
"-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling."
"Okay, we're gonna take a short break."
"Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast."
Yes!
"They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?"
Would it matter?
"Oh, you are so great! Thank you!"
Are you really not going?
"I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?"
"They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them."
If you wanna call that a reason.
"Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I’m-I’m Phoebe Buffay, hi! I’m-I’m-I’m hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we’re doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you’ve been there! Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have them take you home, so… Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen."
Ready?
Uh-huh. Good luck.
Hey honey!
Hi sweetie!
Is Monica not here?
No.
"Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!"
Cool!
"Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!"
"That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?"
"Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part."
"What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?"
"First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor."
"I can do that! ""Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..."" Oh, what's the product?"
Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
I'm cold!
Hey Rach.
Yeah.
What's Emma doing today?
"Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?"
"Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant."
Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
"Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!"
"Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!"
Oh... okay.
"Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy..."
And a thousand dollars.
"...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important..."
"Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition."
Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
"Well, I was thinking..."
"Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid."
Yeah!
You must be Ross.
Hi.
I am Guru Saj.
"Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so..."
"Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!"
What's a koondis?
"I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up."
I guess it's worth a try.
"Oh sure, we should see results -- Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!"
What?! What?!
We appear to have angered it.
We?! We angered it?!
"Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love."
Oh God!
"Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to..."
Ow!!
Oops.
"What was, what was that?"
Well it's gone.
What?! How's that?
It got caught on my watch.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
"Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!"
"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!"
"I don't know, clean places?"
"Umm, yum!"
Howdy doody.
That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Hi liar!
Hey!
Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
Well they could be true.
But they’re not!
"Yeah, it’s a fine line huh?"
Why are you lying to him?
"I don’t know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun."
Honey?
"It’s a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!"
She’s helped so many people to quit smoking.
"Y’know, we’d really better get going."
"Oh right, you’ve got a church group meeting tonight."
Right.
"Well, it was nice meeting you."
You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
"Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We’re waiting! Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?"
Pride.
And dignity.
"Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!"
"Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
"It's actually a $1,000,000 prize."
"Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe PhD."
"Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited."
"You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
And sexy.
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
"Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her."
"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!"
Stop going through my stuff!
"So thanks for the warm welcome. It’s good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let’s go out there and get ‘em! Huh? And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team."
"Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office."
You! Chuckles! What’s your name?
"Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah..."
"No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it’s also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!"
Hey! Don’t you give me any of your—Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn’t that why you guys are here?
Yes! Well that-yes.
Why else would we be here?
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
We actually missed it.
"Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you run in the chapel!"
This is insane!
"What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage."
What?!
"Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas."
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.
Really?!
Yeah!
Oh my God!—Eh! Well…
"Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me."
"Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna."
Bing! That's a great name.
"Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you."
Me too.
"Bye, Chandler."
"So ah, what's wrong with him?"
"Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore."
"Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?"
"No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!"
"Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it."
"Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?"
"Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?"
"Uh, uh, uh, I am here."
I know that.
How are you honey?
How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
"Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I’m sorry about everything that happened and I’d probably never be able to make it up to you, but here’s a start."
What’s this?
"It’s the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche."
What?!
What?!!!
"I’ve been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother’s right, I do look like an ass."
"Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?!"
"Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!"
Why don’t we take it for a spin?
All right!
"Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!"
Tails!
"It’s heads. Gentlemen, pick your category."
Fears and Pet Peeves.
What is Monica’s biggest pet peeve?
Animals dressed as humans.
That’s correct. Ladies?
Same category?
"According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?"
"Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!"
That is correct.
The Irish gig guy?!
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
"Gentlemen, you’re pick."
It’s All Relative.
"Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!"
Nana?
She has a real name.
Althea!
Althea?! What are you doing?!
I took a shot.
Are you sure it was Althea?!
Althea is correct.
Nice shooting!
We’ll take Literature!!
"Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey’s apartment. What name appears on the address label?"
Chandler gets it! It’s Chandler Bing!
No!!
I’m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you’re head!
"Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong."
"Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers....."
"Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?"
Me! On my computer.
Well you sure used a large font.
"Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room."
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Something else I might have said?
"I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!"
"Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay."
"No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting."
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Hey! I got great news!
"Run, Joey! Run for your life!"
"What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?"
No.
"Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?"
"Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey."
Not a problem.
Thanks.
Hi.
"Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?"
"That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful"
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
"Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?"
You got all that from saline solution?
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
"Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and..... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel."
"Hey, you."
How are you?
Good. How are you?
Good.
Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?
"I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!"
"Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia."
"No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth."
Benji?
"Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life."
"Too little, too late, Benji!"
I can't believe this.
"I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?"
No!
Yes!
What?
"I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic."
or...
"Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?"
Maybe...
"Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable."
"Oh God! I am so sorry, but... I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know..."
I'm sorry too...
I love you!
I love you too!
"Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!"
I….can’t….believe this!
And yet somehow it’s true!
I mean this is so great! We’re gonna be baby buddies!
Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!
Hi sweetie!
"Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don’t think you’ve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist’s office. Thank God for adult acne huh?"
I still can’t believe it! I’m the luckiest guy in the world!
Really?
What’d he say?
"Oh y’know what? You have to speak very loudly when you’re talking to Sid, because he’s almost completely deaf."
Oh!
Oh there you go!
I get it!
"So? Congratulations you two, I didn’t even know you got married."
Oh we-we didn’t.
No-no. We…
What?!
"Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all."
Why?!!
"Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this."
Oh. Well then shut me up.
Just tell me how.
"Uh-oh, I feel another one coming."
Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
Oh hi!
Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
Oh! Well let’s look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
No.
All right!
"Oh, here they are right here."
Oh good.
Thanks for your help.
"Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?"
Just call me Paul.
"Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy."
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him.  Are you okay?
You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
"Well, we were very young when we had her."
Oh. We?
"Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to…"
"Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just—I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’"
"I’m just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born."
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Yes I did.
Ohh.
Have you ever seen so much crap?
"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap"
Check this out. Can I have this?
"Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of Grievances."""
"Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too."
"April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent."
"Hey Mike sorry to just drop by like this, can I come in?"
Sure. Who are you?
"I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse."
Oh.
"Yeah, I really, really need to talk to you about something."
"OK, unless... you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?"
No
"Oh, it's just you have that look"
Damn super cuts!
What's up? Is Phoebe OK?
"Oh no, yeah, no, Phoebe is great, but umm... I'm an idiot. Look, right before you guys went out, I accidentally got her all upset."
That's why she was weird.
"Yes, yeah, I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person! Please don't blow her off."
"I'm not blowing her off. I actually just got off the phone with her. We're going out tomorrow night. I mean, I hope that's OK with you, stranger from the coffee house."
"Well then, I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered."
Hey wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said? Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
"Of course she has. If she'd never had a serious relationship, I'd go around broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron."
But you did say it.
"Yes, yes I did. And I will also say what I'm about to say vis-a-vis the following, Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her...super-serious relationship with...Vicrum."
Vicrum?
"What, that's a real name!"
Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
"Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?"
"Yes, hi."
"Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M."
"I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry."
"Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!"
No leg chewing for us sir.
"Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?"
I can’t think of anything we’re doing. Why can’t I think of anything we’re doing?
"Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!"
"Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we’re not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?"
No.
That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
"Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?"
"Monica, what is the matter with you?"
Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
Why? Why today?
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!
"What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?!"
I’ll take that bet.
What?!
"Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!"
Can I get some of that action?
Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?
"Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day."
"Oh, okay!"
Just one last time erm...the marriage thing...there's no wiggle room? None at all?
No but... You don't want to get married either right?
Right. Except that I do want to get married.
Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
You...wanna get married?
Someday.
Aaaaand...hernia.
I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
"Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you."
I want to live with you too! Let's do that!
"But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen."
Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.
Are you gonna change yours?
No.
Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
But I don't want this to end.
I don't want it to end either.
I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed up.
Yeah.
Ok...so. Goodbye.
Bye bye Mike! See ya Mike.
I'm so sorry Phoebs.
We're all sorry.
Ah...look on the bright side...I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.
Rachel?!
"Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
Can I get you some coffee?
"De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?"
"Hi, sure!"
Hi.
Hi!
Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Hey!
Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Okay.
"Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?"
"No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday."
"Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom."
"Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!"
"Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…"
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
I call Godfather!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
"Sure, if you cared enough to call it first."
"Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us."
"Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps."
"Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you."
"Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything."
Okay.
"Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?"
"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese."
"Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!"
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
"Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!"
"Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?"
"Yeah, that sounds about right."
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
And-and a power tie?
"No, pretty much just a towel."
Oh God.
So you guys want me to take this back?
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
"Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?"
Big Bird's friend.
I see pizza!
"Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!"
Hello? Who are we spying on?
"White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?"
"Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!"
"Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman."
Please tell me it's his mother.
Definitely not his mother.
"Oh, no..."
"Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!"
How's my Bing-a-ling?
"Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me."
Why are your eyes so white?
"You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!"
Oh my God!!
All right!
How did you know?
"Joey told me, he saw you two kissing."
In the park?
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Just those two!
"Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!"
"Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?"
Here.
"Respectfully, professor R. Geller. Hey!"
Hi!
"Hey, how was the Met?"
The museum was amazing!
"Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?"
"Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense."
What do you mean?
"Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around."
"Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?"
"No, we went to the left."
"Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together."
"Yeah, it's fun."
What?
"Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird."
"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on."
"Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?"
"Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
"Yeah, I guess that's true."
"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is."
He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
That was going to be my next argument.
Rachel?
Yeah.
"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?"
"Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?"
"Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever."
"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
"Oh, thanks, sweetie."
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Really?
Yeah.
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
Can't wait.
"Come on, they're gonna love you."
"Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video."
"Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie."
This is for the fourth grade.
"Huh? Where, whaddya mean?"
"Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean."
"What, what's what you mean?"
"My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18."
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
"Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this."
"Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back."
Hello?
Hey!
Hi.
Hi! What-what're you doing here?
"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!"
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
"Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?"
"Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'"
"Thank you, Max. Thank you."
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
"Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88."
"What, you don't think I know that?"
"Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!"
"Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that."
"Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about."
"Yeah, in a poem maybe."
"No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel."
You don't have it anymore?
"No, I ah, I slept with someone else."
"Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?"
It didn't.
"Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice."
"Now, wh-what, what is that like?"
"It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her."
"Yeah, yeah."
I-I can’t go in there. I can’t tell him!
"Honey, it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for."
Thank you.
Okay.
Hey! It’s my fashion girls! What’s wrong?
"Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you."
"Oh. What’s, what’s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad’s heart? Is that a sandwich?"
"Joe, mom and dad are fine…"
Is that a sandwich?!
Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?
I’m pregnant.
What?!
Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
"Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!"
What?! Dina…
Bub!!! I can’t believe this! You’re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
"Bobby Corso, but he’s a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He’s real funny."
"You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…laugh! All right, I’ll be back in a little while! You stay here!"
Why? Where are you going?
I can’t look at you right now!
Wow.
I know.
"Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck."
That’s sweet.
"No, it’s more like a  good luck."
"So uh, what did this woman look like?"
"She was like 30, dark hair, attractive."
"Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?"
"Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?"
"No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive…  Hold on one second; let me check this out."
What are you doing?
"Well, let’s see… Okay uh, is that her?"
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
"Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend."
Did you break up with her?
"No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her."
Why?
"Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…"
Fat?!
"I did not say fat! I said, ""Fa-aa-aw-ow…"""
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
"Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?"
"Well, apparently she does."
"Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me."
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Joey!!
All right! Hey-hey!
Hi!!
Who's your friend? He's hot!
Thanks man.
"What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!"
"Ross, we can handle this."
"Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!"
"Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!"
"Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?"
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love."
Love is the best medicine.
That’s laughter.
Why do you do it?
I don’t know.
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?"
"Yeah, I do."
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?"
Yes.
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
I'm going to China.
"Jeez, you say one thing, and..."
You're going to China?
"Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo—it's—it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary. Um... here's a picture of me..."
"Oh, let me see!"
"Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?"
Yeah.
"Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
"Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?"
"Ah, we're out. I sold them all."
What?
"Monica, I'm cutting you off."
"No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!"
"Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck."
Oh God!
"So, how many have you sold so far?"
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
"Oh my God, how did you do that?"
"Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'"
Hey.
Hey.
"I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever."
"Why, nobody good?"
"Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!"
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
"Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'"
"Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?"
"Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool."
"Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never."
"Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star."
"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right."
"What's wrong, sweetie?"
"Nothing, nothing."
"Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon."
"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't."
Oh. They don't.
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
What?
Intense and creepy.
Oh.
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way."
"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!"
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'."
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
"Hey, you've got a boyfriend!"
"I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!"
"Look, there's Chandler, you know, that stupid friend of Ross' who said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!"
It... You can so totally tell.
I KNOW!
"Well let's see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going."
Aren't you...?
"Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving."
Right. So how're you doing?
Bitchin'
Hi Monica.
Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you. NOT.
O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Oh.
Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Dad!
"Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea."
You what?
"I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun."
Define fun.
"C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch..."
"...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun."
"Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'."
That's probably what they'll say.
I'd like that.
"Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?"
Okay...
"When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family."
"Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever."
"Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes."
I love you too.
Uh Joey...
Yeah?
Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
"Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?"
I do.
"Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?"
I do.
I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
"I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing."
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
"Yeah, we were…we were just looking around."
"Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?"
Uhh….
"Ah… Ah…Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?"
"Uh, actually I find Marion’s views far to progressionist."
I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
"I’m sorry, who are you?"
"I’m a professor here uh, Ross…Geller."
"Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It’s uh—Wait! Did you write this?"
Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!
"Y’know, you look nothing like I would’ve thought. You’re…you’re so young."
"Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
What-what about Monica?
"Oh, she isn’t home."
"So it would just be, me alone?"
"Well, Ben would be there."
Huh umm…
What’s the matter?
"Well that—y’know it’s just uh, I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone."
"Rach, he’s not an ex-con."
"Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?"
I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Okay.
"Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?"
Yeah I think so.
I wasn’t talking to you.
I’ll be okay.
"Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour."
Bye dad.
"Bye. Ahhh… So this is fun, huh?"
Not really.
"Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?"
Okay.
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
I’m not allowed to have soda.
Okay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
What’s a virgin?
Water it is.
"Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there."
Mike?? Who's Mike?
Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
"That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!"
It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
"Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!"
She does?
Let's get you out of here!!
At least you took me down with you!
"I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?"
"I guess, in time."
Yeah.
"I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone."
"You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!"
Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
"Oh Joey, I’m hardly a…"
My little sister Dina!
Right! Hi Dina!
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks so much for meetin’ with me. Joey’s told me so much about you!
"This is so exciting for her. Well, I’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business."
"Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…"
"I…I don’t care about fashion! I’m pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!"
And there’s marketing…
Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
A lot of people are thankful for those.
Hello? Rachel?
Who is it?
It's your favorite sister.
Jill?
Amy.
Hide my rings.
Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Do you have a hair straightener?
Um... hi.
Oh... hi...
Aw.
Hair straightener?
I haven't seen you in like... a year.
"Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed."
Oh well yeah me too. Um... I had a baby.
I decorated Dad's office.
"Oh... yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, not the same thing."
"Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey... I really need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house."
Oh my God!
mh hmm...
Is this Emmett?
Uh..... its Emma.
Its a girl?
Hey Amy.
"Oh Amy, you remember Ross."
Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy she used to date.
That was me.
"No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade."
Still me.
"No, I'm not talking about you. It was your fat friends brother with that bad afro, do you remember?"
"Amy. I'm going to save you some time, ok. All me."
"Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune."
I didn’t know you read tea leaves.
"Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots."
"Okay, I’m done. Read mine."
"Okay. Ooh, I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death."
I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted.
"Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?"
"Okay, I’m done. Do mine."
"Okay. Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle."
Ah.
Oh! Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!
"Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab."
What does yours say Pheebs?
"Umm… Wow, all right. Wow! Yay! Ooh, I’m gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night."
Hey!
"Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl."
Who isn't?
"I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross."
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Nevermind!
"No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in."
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm…
Jen.
"Jen, I know this may sound a little…But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or…"
Sure! That would be nice.
Umm?
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
I will give you a call.
I'll see you later.
Okay!
I forgot my paper.
Hi Rachel!
Happy Thanksgiving!
You too sweetheart!
Hey!
Oh my!
"Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!"
Ross!
"Oh, this is Monica."
"Hi, I'm Ross's little sister."
Okay.
"I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry."
"Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food."
"Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then."
"Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner."
"Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in."
Hey.
She really left.
I know.
Thank you.
No problem roomie.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure!
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Incentive For Men?
"Oh, I'll take some of that."
"Pheebs, that's for men!"
"No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. Yeah."
Hey!
Hey!
"Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so…"
"Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben?"
"Okay, I’ll see you later pal."
"Ohh, okay. Wh—Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it."
What?
"I can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting. You’ve got something here on your back."
What? That’s great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Oh I…
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
"All right, that’s it! Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man!"
No! Wait! Come on!
Hey.
Hey.
"Aww, is it broken?"
"No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks."
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket."
"…so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles."
Sounds like a fun party.
"Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that."
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
"Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you."
"Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags."
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
"Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head."
I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Shut up!
You must stop!
That only took me an hour.
"Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--"
"Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!"
"Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer."
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
You're all invited to bite me!
Hello?
"Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!"
Who is this?
"This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but I know she really wants to be with you!"
He... he's gonna propose?
"I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!"
"Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you."
"You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!"
"Well, I hope you're happy!"
"Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!"
"Phoebe is going to say ""Yes"" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!"
"Phoebe is going to say ""yes""? That's, that's great!"
"No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!"
And there's not chance that will work?
"No, I called him. It's not gonna happen."
Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
"Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!"
This vacation sucks!!
"Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now."
Looking up?
"Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure."
"Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right."
"Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?"
"Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032."
"That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day."
That’s what you think.
"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?"
"Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse."
What was her name?
Nesele Toulouse.
Nestle Tollhouse?!
"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language."
"Phoebe, is this the recipe?"
Yes!! Ohh.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you’re burning in hell!!
"Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?"
"Yeah, what is it?"
"Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!"
"Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it."
"I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible."
"All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose."
No.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
Yeah! You're the best!
"Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too."
"That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!"
Your sunglasses?!
Yes!
"Oh, right!"
"Hey, big..."
Shhhh!
...spender.
She's still asleep.
So how'd it go?
"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Isn't she beautiful?
"Look at her, my first grandchild."
What about Ben?
"Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. Wow."
"Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?"
"Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room."
"Yay! It's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there."
Yeah right.
"Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel."
What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
"Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy."
"Oh, I gotta get back to work."
You don’t have to be back for a half-hour!
"Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker."
"Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right?"
"Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife."
"Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired."
"I am not gonna get fired, because I’m not gonna act on it."
So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else?
Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut in marketing!
Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club.
Dude that is so sad.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Could I play?
Barry?
Come in.
Are you sure?
"Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours."
Huh?!
"So, how ya doin?"
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
"Yeah, well.."
"Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging."
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
I dumped him.
Okay.
Ross!
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Daddy!
You’re next!!
Okay. I didn’t know he was here.
"Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, ""Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"""
"Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…"
"No, let me explain! Fired!!"
"All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy."
What?
And I too am just a love machine.
"Ross, let me show you where the guest room is."
Hi Rachel!
Hi!
Come on in.
It's really nice to see you again.
Thank you.
"Oh Rachel, uhh…"
What?
Just ah…
Excuse me?
Here let me…
"Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I, hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir."
"Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!"
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
You got ink on your lip.
Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh….
"Hi! Will, right?"
Right.
Hi! I’m Rachel Green.
Oh I-I remember you.
"Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis’ graduation party?"
You are unbelievable.
Thank you!
"Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go."
"That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…"
"Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening."
Yeah.
"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself."
Helps a little.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
"Yeah, have a seat."
I’m so sorry.
"That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?"
"Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?"
What do you mean?
You seem to really like her.
"Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment."
"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks."
You think?
"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
"Hey, you’re right."
Yeah.
Thanks. What photo album was it?
"I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids."
"Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!"
"Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work."
"But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!"
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.
No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!
"All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?"
"That’s right! ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don’t read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!"
I got you a present!
"Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!"
"I know, but you have to open it today!"
Okay.
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Wow!
"For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary."
Do we have to?
No.
"Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there."
"Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!"
"Yeah, I think we should see other people."
"But we can go, right?"
Yes.
Okay!
It's a great idea.
"Okay, I'm gonna go too!"
"Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary."
"Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London."
"Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!"
"Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!"
"Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham."
"Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it’s the Gellers. Darling, it’s the Gellers. She’s very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her."
"Sorry, what?"
It’s the Gellers!
Where?
Well there’s one  and there’s another.
Lovely to meet you.
Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
"Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we’re happy to do it."
"We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw."
"Ha ha, a joke that’s funny in all countries."
What the hell!!!
"what’s up, Dad?"
This bill for my half of the wedding. it’s insane.
How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
"Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I’m paying to remodel this guys house. I’m going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind."
"Dad, dad, please. Look I don’t want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?"
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
"Ooh, Jack....Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be."
And I’m going to go get drunk.
Hi.
"Oh, hey."
Hi.
"I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me."
"Yeah, I'm sorry man."
"Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?"
"Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him."
Oh.
Oh!
What was that?
Monica knows.
"It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother."
I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!!
Look I was going to tell you!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.
What?
You’re kidding!
Oh my God!!
Ross!
"Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage."
"Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?"
"Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it."
"Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!"
"Phoebe, I told her you already knew."
Another lie. You have a sickness!
"Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?"
So... how many guys have your key?
"No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend."
Your lipstick's on his mouth.
"Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade."
"No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days."
Did you uhm...
"No, no..."
...kiss him?
"Oh, well, yeah..."
"Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella."
Don't point your finger at me.
Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it...
"Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go."
"All right... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk... well, you just better watch out."
"Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out."
"Oh, you're going to Minsk?"
"Well, I might."
"Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there."
"Okay, well... guys?"
Right... Goodbye Phoebe.
"Hey, what are you kidding me?"
"Right-o, right-o... Take good care of her."
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand."
It's never gonna happen again right?
Right! Never! Never! I swear!
"I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number. We'll uhm... we'll party up Vladnik style."
"Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again."
So we do Supergirl.
"No, it’s me. Phoebe!"
"Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume…"
"Oh, you did this to him?"
What?! I thought he’d love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
"Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all."
No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
Hey!
You didn’t dress up either?!
"Yes I did! I’m Chandler. Dude, what happened?"
How is that me?
Okay. I’m Chandler.
That is so you!
When have I ever done that?!
When have I ever done that?!
"Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…"
"Yeah, you’re roommate is a soap opera star."
"Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty."
"Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me."
"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby."
Well who would?
"Well we haven't officially asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler."
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
"yeah oh my god, I'm so moved."
"I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die and I don't get your baby?"
"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby."
Connected? I mean... to what? She's... she's a lump.
"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two... that you two....."
This guy? Seriously?
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
"I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!"
"Taffy, really? I’ve never had any."
Ever?!
"Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, you’re just never going to tell her?"
"Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me."
"If I haven’t said it before: she’s a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What’s the deal? Oh, it’s nice! May I try a pink one?"
"Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?"
He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
"Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?"
You got it!
Thanks! Thank you!
"Dude, I am sorry about what I said!"
"No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!"
It’s not that bad.
"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
"So, you’re just Bing?"
I have no name.
"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?"
"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint."
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
"Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?"
"Umm, Gene."
It’s Clint. It’s Clint!
"See you later, Gene."
"Bye, Gene."
It’s Clint! Clint!
What’s up with Gene?
Hello?
"Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?"
Yeah.
"For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport."
Yay.
"Uh, Rach, hang on."
Phoebe? Is everything okay?
"Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane."
What? Why?
I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
"Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane."
"Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris."
"Uhm, what was that?"
"Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange."
"Okay, that doesn't sound good."
"I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right."
But she is sometimes.
Well...
"Wait, what are you doing?"
"Well, I can't take this plane now."
"Excuse me, sir, where are you going?"
"I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange."
Could I get some peanuts?
What's wrong with the plane?
There's nothing wrong with the plane.
Yeah! The left Philange!
There is no Philange!
Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
I'm not flying on it!
"Ma'am, please sit down!"
What's going on?
We're all getting off. There is no Philange!
This is ridiculous! I...
"Yeah, okay."
"Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen."
I was probably waiting for it to open.
"I gotta tell you, you look great now."
You look great too.
You’re an excellent patient!
So how does it look?
"Well, you’ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days."
Like a pirate?!
If that helps you.
"Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music."
Good deal.
"Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people."
Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
Vince is a fireman.
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
"98 hot saves, highest in the force."
"Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred."
"Fire safety is not a joke, son."
"You're right, I know."
"Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight.  See you Saturday."
Okay.
"Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher."
"Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight."
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
"I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler."
"So Pheebs, do they know about each other?"
"Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't."
"Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I’m going down to the Xerox place."
"Oh, no thanks."
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of."
"Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?"
"Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?"
Yeah! You wanna come?
Yeah!
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Can I help you?
Uh-oh.
"Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it."
"Chloe, switch with me, there’s some guys here that got a crush on you."
"Okay, that hurt us."
Hi guys. I haven’t seen you since this morning.
"Well ah, ........y'know."
"Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
Both of us?
Maybe. Does that scare ya?
Relax. It’s just Issac’s D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
We’ll be there.
"Great. I’ll ah, see ya then."
"All right, rock on."
"Y’know what? Actually I’m kinda glad they’re leaving ‘cause uh, I need to talk to you about something."
What’s up?
"Well this uh, this may be a little awkward."
"Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night."
"No, its…Its not that. Umm, now what I’m going to say to you, I’m not saying as your friend. Okay? I’m-I’m saying as it as Monica’s older brother."
But you’re still my friend?
Not for the next few minutes.
"During this time…are you, are you still my best man?"
Nope.
Do I still call you Ross?
"Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn’t be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica’s older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I’m-I’m-I’m serious! Come—Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I’m-I’m not kidding here!"
"Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning."
No problem.
So are we…friends again?
Yeah.
Okay. You won’t believe what Monica’s older brother just said to me!
Monica!
She’s sleeping.
"I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?"
"Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up."
"Sorry, I just…can’t sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I’m like…"
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
What?! Ow!
"Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?"
"Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restaurant, ordered champagne, nice."
"The guy still won't put out, huh?"
"Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh."
Sorry Phoebs.
"Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?"
"Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean."
"No, whad'ya mean? He's not British."
Maybe he's. . . gay.
"Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something."
"Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?"
"No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell."
Hey! Well...?
You were incredible!
Yeah?
You blew them away!
"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?"
I was not!
"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!"
Oh my God! I'm your groupie!
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Phoebe Buffay?!
"Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer—fireman, can-can I help you?"
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
That’s not mine.
Yes it is.
How do you know?
"The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don’t wrap it in a blanket that says, ""Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."""
"Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!"
"Please reattach this, it’s against the law to disconnect them."
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
There’s a reset button under the plastic cover.
"There’s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!"
"Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi."
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
"Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!"
Go Joe!!!
Helloo! Oh!
Pheebs! There you are!
"No it's not, sorry."
"But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!"
"Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants."
"Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it."
"Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"It's okay, these things happen."
"But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that."
"I'm, I'm okay. See."
"Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit."
"No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."
"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent."
They actually said that?
"Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I..."
"No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent."
"Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah."
Happy birthday!!!
Happy birthday!!!
Rach! Come on! Rach!
It’s your birthday!
Hey.
She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don’t use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
They do!
Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Chocolate-chip pancakes!
We’ve got presents!
Good ones?
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
"Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?"
"Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal."
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
"Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost an entire turkey to eat."
Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin’ chips is like stretching.
All right.
"Don’t worry, Tribbianis never get full."
"I actually know what you’re talking about. I’m here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void."
Who the hell is this guy?
Will! From high school.
Oh hey!
Joey.
Hello.
Will!
Ross!
Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! Hot stuff?
It’s good to see you man.
"Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?"
I’m a commodities broker.
Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
"Yeah, it’s not. But I’m rich and thin."
"Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis’ graduation party."
That was such a fun night!
"Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun."
Yeah.
Yeah.
God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
Yeah.
He-hee!
"Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane."
"This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!"
"Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun."
Is there something wrong?
"All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road."
Joey...
"No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?"
"Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that."
Oh!
"No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you."
"Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
I don't think so.
"Oh, I do. How you doin?"
I'm OK
What?!?!
What?
Oh dear God!
Hi!
"Hey, look at you! Where have you been?"
"Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny."
How did that happen?
That yeti is one smooth talker.
"I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready."
"Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room."
No! Why?
"Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind."
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
"Ross, I…"
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
"Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down."
"All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor…"
Hello?
"Hey, it's me."
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr."
What?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
I have no idea what you just said.
Put Joey on the phone.
What's up man?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
"Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen."
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
"Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!"
Right.
"Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?"
Okay.
Thanks. I-I think I’m dying. I really do.
"Oh, poor baby."
"Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!"
"Ross, they are killing you out there!"
That’s not true!
She’s right! You have to stop!
"What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!"
"Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!"
I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
"Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
"Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
"Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect."
"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
Or?
"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
Burning's good.
"Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca."
"Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man."
"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."
Can we just start throwing things in?
"Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK."
"Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts."
"Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah."
"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
No.
Eww!
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure…"
"Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place."
"Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name."
"No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?"
"Yeah, it takes two incomes."
"Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie."
"Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room."
"Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy."
"Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie."
Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
"No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this."
Where did you go to do it?
Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
YOU NEVER DID IT!
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
"Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me."
Here you go.
"Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?"
"Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it."
"All right, let's see, call me Mrs. Hannigan."
Mrs. Hannigan?
"What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it."
Damnit!
Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! I have to talk to you!!
Hi Amy!
You're not Rachel.
Still sharp as a tack!
"Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie."
Hi!
Hi!
Nice to meet you.
H-Hi!! And you are...?
Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
"Yes, yes, you did."
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! Wow! You remember Joey?
"Yeah! Hey, sure! The ""Days of Our Lives"" guy!"
"That's right, yeah."
You're not good!
Always nice to meet a fan!
"So now, what are you doing here?"
"Well, I have huge news."
"Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!"
"Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait?"
Ehm... Her name is Emma.
"Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!"
What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
"Hey, your English is getting better!!"
Oh my God!
"I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated."
What... what you working on?
"Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so..."
Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
What did I just say?
"Watch. Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest."
"Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... ""brainy, bright, clever"", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!"
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Oooh!
W-wait. What is that?
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
"No, no, I don't."
"Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?"
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
"C'mon, tell us."
"Yeah, is she really 20."
I am not telling you guys anything.
"C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously."
"Dad, you really don't want to do that."
"Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?"
"Jack, would you let it go?"
"Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster."
"Guys. Seriously, it is not like that."
"Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . ."
"Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence."
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
"So, Saturday night!"
I'd love to!
Great!
So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
"Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?"
"Sure, he was in your ""band""?"
It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Sorry.
"That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!"
Really?
"Yeah, why?"
"Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!"
You did?
Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
AND ON MY TURF?
"Rach, these are for you."
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
"OK, Phoebs, your turn."
"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?"
Uh-huh.
You guuuyys.
"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
You got me a cola drink?
"And, a lemon lime."
"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater."
And last but not least.
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
"The wife says ""Hi!""."
Ah. Fun conversation?
"Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen."
"Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?"
"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
"Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!"
...Missy?
I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
You are to me...
"No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!"
So? I'm married.
I'm happily married.
Oh. - What's that like?
"Right. So, I'm sorry..."
"Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?"
"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us."
"Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?"
May I help you?
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
"Well, I'm, I'm sorry...Ahhh. Have we met?"
"It's Eddie you freak, your roommate."
"I, I'm sorry, I uh  I already have a roommate."
Hello.
"Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man."
"No he, he moved out and I moved in."
"Well I, I think we'd remember something like that."
I know I would.
"Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terribly sorry."
Hey no problem.
See ya. Goodbye you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
"Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is..."
Welcome home man.
A little foos?
Absolutely.
What happened to the foosball?
Ah that's a cantelope.
What are you playing with?
"Oh, it's my new beeper."
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
"Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'"
"No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO."
"A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid."
"All right, I'll see you guys later."
Off to see young Ethan?
Thank you.
How young is young Ethan? Young?
He's... our age.
When we were?
"Okay, he's a senior in college."
College?
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
"No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22."
What?
"Oh, I can't pass for 22?"
"Well, maybe 25-26."
I am 26.
There you go.
What are you doing?
The key’s stuck in the lock.
I can fix it. Hold on.
It still doesn’t work.
I’m not finished.
Oh.
Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.
How desperate am I?
"Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game."
I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.
How come?
"Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect."
"Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do."
You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.
Ow!
Who are you?
"Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?"
I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
Oh.
I hate my parents.
"I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening."
Like what?
"Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!"
What are you? Eight?
"Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea."
I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
"Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?"
I really don't.
"What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends."
My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
"Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways."
"This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?"
"Yeah, yeah, I guess."
"Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?"
"Yeah, maybe."
Then you gotta let them go.
"I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?"
I read a lot.
Just when I thought we could be friends.
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
"I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?"
"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?"
"Wait a second, I could star in it!"
Or that.
"I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it."
"I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do."
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Yeah!
Thanks!
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character."
Done!
And it can't be Joey.
It's not.
Or Joseph.
Oh.
"And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn’t really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it."
"Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?"
"Oh, I couldn’t eat now."
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Chicken? Chicken boy!
"My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!"
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Yeah.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
"How's that coffee comin,' dear?"
"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan."
"I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy."
I know!
"I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?"
Op.
Eh.
"Oh, you got me."
"Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?"
"Oh, that sounds great."
"Come on over here, sweetheart."
"Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much."
I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
"Hey, big guy, game time."
"Hey, be right there."
There's a game?
"Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel."
It's the basketball playoffs.
"Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other."
"Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'"
"Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks."
"Uh, it's the college playoffs."
"Oh, then go Vassar."
"Uh, they're not in it."
"Ok, then just go."
Ok.
"Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them."
"Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?"
"Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!"
"Well, Joey’s my best friend."
I’m not your best friend?
You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
"All right, all right, at least I’m prepared."
Okay.  Oh yes.
Hey!
Hey-hey!
These aren’t for you! Are you upset?
I am now!
Hi honey I’m home.
From the tequila factory?
"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!"
Come here. I can breath throw my mouth.
"Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives."
"I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?"
"Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet."
"Oh, hello liar."
"Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike."
I could’ve been killed I hope you know!
"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!"
"Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects."
"Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball."
"Yeah, so?"
And now I've picked it up again.
"Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!"
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
"Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it."
"Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much."
"Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations"
"Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?"
"Aww, not right now."
"Oh, but that's okay."
I know.
Yeah.
"So, I'll get-get back to my friend."
"Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?"
"Oh, that'd be great."
Okay!
Thanks.
Bye!
"Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life."
"Anyway, I’m going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator’s date? So that when we, it’s time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he’s really, he’s kinda cute."
"Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?"
"Hey, don’t call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!"
"Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?"
"Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight."
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times."
You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
He says he was too.
Interesting.
So I was wondering....
"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit."
"Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?"
I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
"Oh, really."
"Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?"
"Well, I was having a conversation."
"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other."
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
That would be great. Thank you.
Hey.
So how was Joan?
I broke up with her.
"They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them."
"Come on, they were not that huge."
"I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain."
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
"Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts."
You or me?
"I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples."
"You guys are messin' with me, right?"
Yeah.
"That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa."""
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Maureen Rosilla.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
"Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky."
We'll give you Janice.
"I miss Janice though. ""Hello, Chandler Bing."""
"""Oh, my, god."""
"""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"""
"Stop with the broom, we're not making noise."
We won. We won!
Hey!
Hey! Where's Mike?
"Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig."
"Yeah? Yeah, where is it?"
"Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party."
Rock on!
"Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff?"
"Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange."
"Amy, hi!"
"I took your advice, I left Myron."
"Oh, good for you!"
I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
"Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!"
"Thank you! So, can I stay with you?"
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
"I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room."
"Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down."
They kept your room for a while.
"Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!"
"Come on, you know they love you."
As much as they love you?
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.
"Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me..."
I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
You're the best friend I ever had.
""
What?
I... I... I...
That is so sweet.
Where is Emily?
"Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle."
"Man, didn’t she like just get here?"
Yeah!! Yeah!
Easy tiger.
"I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, ""Well, I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."""
So what are you going to do?
"Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!"
What?
I could ask her to live with me!
Are you serious?
"I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!"
"Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!"
"Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know?"
"And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now."
"All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!"
I don’t want to do that.
"No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!"
"Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys."
"Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go."
Hey.
Welcome back!
Ah! I missed you
"Oh, me too!"
"So, what's new?"
"Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay."
That's great! You changed you name?
Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!
You're kidding right?
Nope.
You really did that?
Yep.
"Yeah, but you can't do that."
"Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it."
"Alright, then I'm gonna change my name."
"Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?"
Crap Bag.
Mike Crap Bag?
"No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag."
"You're not serious, right?"
"Yeah, I'm serious. It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!"
"Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it."
"I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela."
And I love Crap.
Oww!
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Oww!
"Oh my God, is that still..."
"I'm fine, I'm fine."
No you're not.
Yes I am!
Rach!
"Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!"
"Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?"
"No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet."
"And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!"
"Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then."
Rach...
"But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready."
Rachel...
"Look, either help me or go."
Fine. I'll go.
I can't believe you let them win!
"Yeah, at least you hide your feelings well about it."
I was frustrated.
It was my racquet.
I was frustrated with you!
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
"Y'know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the ""I'll see you around, Bing!"" ""Not if I see you first, Doug!"" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up."
"Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight."
Bing!
Oww!!
Game!
"Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. Are you all right sweetheart?"
I'm not all right.
"We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water."
"Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!"
"Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game."
"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said."
Let them win one.
"Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills."
You're not even giving them a chance!
They have racquets don't they?!
"Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game."
"Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!"
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Where is she?
I don't see her.
Rachel! Rachel Green!
There she is!
Rachel! Rachel!
"Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?"
"No, no, I just have to talk to someone."
"I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass."
"No, no, no, but..."
RACHEL!!
Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
"Okay, you're on."
"What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?"
"Okay, the thing is.."
Yeah?
Don't go.
What?
"Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go."
Oh my God.
"I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane."
Miss? Are you boarding the plane?
"Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do."
Miss?
I - I have to get on the plane.
"No, you don't."
"Yes, I do."
"No, you don't."
"They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
Rachel?
I'm so sorry.
I really thought she'd stay.
I'm sorry.
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
"Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now."
"Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?"
"No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece."
"Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know—Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?"
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
"No, not since I lost her at the airport."
I can't believe she can out run you man!
"HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!"
"Hey. Look, I know you’ve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate."
"No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again."
Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
"Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class."
What’s a Movement class?
It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime.
"Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!"
"Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years."
"No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!"
"You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred…"
"Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?"
"Oh okay, I’ll-I’ll try."
"All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?"
"Yeah so, Tuesday?"
"Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!"
Thank you.
Okay.
"Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?"
What? I get my own room?
You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
"Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?"
No!
Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
Thanks.
Thank you. Mon?
Hmm?
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
"He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try…"
"Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced."
"Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married."
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
"If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!"
"Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?"
I have nothing to say to you.
"Wow, my flat is twice this size!"
"Please, Monica? In the hall?"
"Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly."
"Well, aren't you a treat."
Nice to see you Rachel.
"Oh, hi!"
So glad you brought someone.
"Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson.  He’s the head of my department."
"Oh, hi."
And I also brought my friend Joey…
Oh!! Shrimp toast!
"Well, y’know I-I don’t know where he is."
"Well, I hope you’re gonna bid on some things Rachel."
"Well, y’know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris."
"Ohh, nice choice."
Yeah.
Good luck.
"Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars."
Hey!
Hey!
So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
"Oh, that sounds good!"
"Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?"
It's all done!
"Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it."
"I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane..."
"Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?"
"Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them."
Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
"So, how did you enjoy the play?"
"Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry."
Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
You really liked it?
"Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained not to listen! But after chapter 16: ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", I was uplifted."
Oh really!
"Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!"
No!
Did somebody sign your bra?
So I got it when I was 13...
Hi.
Hey!
"Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage."
Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
No...i really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Why?
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
Never?
Never.
wow...are you still going to move in with him?
"I want to...but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know...that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!"
Yeah...marriage...stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
That's not how you really feel is it?
"No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage."
Seriously? You divorce-o?
"If you have to call me name, I prefer Ross the Divorcer. It's just cooler. Look...I know my marriages haven't exactly worked out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Caroline and I had some good times before she became a lesbian! And once afterward. I'm sorry."
It's ok that's how you feel.
But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun...and you love Mike.
I do love Mike.
Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before... and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
"The Divorcer, to the rescue!"
It's not cooler.
Yeah I just heard it.
"And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman’s day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!"
I won! That was my guess!
What?! What?! What?!
"I guessed 20,000!"
"Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess, you buy!"
"What?! I don’t have 20,000!"
"Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!"
"Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!"
Joey's not going.
I didn't finish my five pages.
"Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?"
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
"Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done."
"I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball."
"Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played."
"The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed."
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
"Come on look guys, don't fight."
"And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing."
"Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?"
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
"Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!"
"How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!"
I paid for those tickets!
"No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!"
Oh yeah!
So?
I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
"Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now."
Really?
"Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting."
"That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way."
Yeah?
Yeah.
"Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone."
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
"Oh, then it must've been you. Bye."
Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
"Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore."
I think on some levels she already knows.
"Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now."
"Okay, well maybe not on those levels."
": Tribbiani! Hold on, I’ll get the plunger."
"Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord."
: And tell him what?
"Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry."
: Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
I have actually not heard of that.
": Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief. I’m gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother’s apartment. Your friends are outta here pal."
Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know!
Tah-daaah!
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
"Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for."
"Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask."
"Well, whaddya think?"
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Uh-oh...
How-how did that happen?
"I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table."
"Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while."
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
"Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out."
"You guys, I am not that bad!"
"Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!"
That is so unfair!
"Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!"
"Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook."
"Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away."
Why not?
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
I could do that.
"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout."
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood..."
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Monica? You're Mom.
"So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?"
This bottle opener.
And?
And it’s a magnet!
Look at that!
"How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen."
What?!
"You complete me kitchen, matey!"
"Ross, I know what you’re thinking."
What?
"That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad."
Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
What?!!
"Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, ""Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?"" ""Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?"" ""When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?"" You want her!"
No!
"Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?"
"Oh, how bad is it?"
"Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!"
How’s your room Rach?
Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Isn’t that mine?
Fine! I’m sorry for your loss!
"Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just say it’s Rachel?"
Yes.
"Um, you…you like Rachel?"
Yes. I like Rachel.
Rachel?!
"Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross."
But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
"Yeah, but it’s not a big deal."
"It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?"
"I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic."
Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?
"Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away."
Y’know what? I-I gotta go.
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…
I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?!
Hey.
"Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am…"
That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.
"Well, I’m still sorry. Is he here?"
In the box.
Chandler?
"Oh, he-he can’t talk right now."
Why not? What’s going on?
He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
By being in a box?
"Joey, had reasons."
They were threefold.
"Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm… Listen I don’t wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can’t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don’t wanna be the cause of that. So, I don’t think we can see each other anymore. I’m gonna go to my mom’s in Chicago, I’m gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could’ve be something really amazing, but y’know this is probably for the best. Y’know? I’m gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler."
This game makes no sense!
Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.
"Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here."
"All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card."
Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
"Either, it makes no difference."
"Choose, you jackass!"
I’ll take a card.
"Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!"
What?!
This game is kinda fun.
You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you…
I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
Hey!
Hey!
"Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you."
"Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!"
"Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!"
"Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!"
"Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the ""Paleontology Review""! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!"
Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
Yeah. Why?
Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
Your ex-boyfriend?
Yeah.
"So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!"
"No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you."
"Well, if you think it would help."
"Yes, absolutely. I'll call him."
"Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?"
Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
We'll see how dinner goes.
"Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?"
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
"‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping."
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
"Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?"
"She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it."
"Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me."
"I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out."
"Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you."
"No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh."
Hi!
"Hey Mon, how's it going?"
"Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight."
"Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad."
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
"Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?"
"It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me."
"Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there."
"I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say ""get out of my office!"""
"Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?"
"I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;"
"Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a thing?"
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
"No, no, Dad, I was just wondering."
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
"Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?"
"Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew."
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
"No, we can go to Williamsburg."
Eat your fish.
Wow! You look like... like my mom.
I'm wearing pantyhose!
Great! Come on in!
"Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!"
"No, my parents are rich."
"Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. HELLO!"
"Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy."
Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
It's so nice to finally meet you!
And you... Your home is lovely.
"Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually three floors."
Holy crap!
"Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet our friends?"
"Oh, try and stop me!"
Hey... Wh... What are you doing?
I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
"Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not Phoebe..."
Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
"Well, come on..."
"Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle."
"Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself... So where are you from?"
"Uhm... Okay, well, all right, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh...  So... where does everyone summer?"
Hey! Sleeping beauty!
Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
"Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?"
I’m so sorry.
"Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?"
What?!
"Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!"
"You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…"
"Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?"
"Yes, yes I was."
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
"Yeah, yeah. Why?"
Lilly's dead.
She what?!
She's dead.
Are you sure?
"Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake."
I can't believe this. I just—I can't believe this. How-how—Oh my God. How long ago?
17 years ago.
"Oh! What about, what about the girls?"
"Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch."
"Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!"
"Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don’t, I don’t know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty."
"Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there."
"So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?"
"Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go."
"All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father."
That's a defense?
"Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!"
You make up songs?
"Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm. Sleepy girl, sleepy girl. Why won't you go to sleep? Sleepy girl, sleepy girl. You're, you're, you're keeping me uppp! Yeah."
Are we in London?
What are you doing here? You can’t be here!
"I’ve uh, I’ve come to talk to Ross."
What?
"Nothing. No, nothing."
"I was going to call him, but…"
"Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I’m right, right?"
I’d really rather talk to him.
Oh.
"I uh, I’ve been to his apartment and he wasn’t there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?"
"Ross, are you there? Ross, I don’t know if you can hear this but… I’m gonna talk anyway, uh, I’m in the States with you sister and your friends and it’s all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you—Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you."
"I love you too! I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can’t hear me."
"I wish I could know if you’d heard any of that. I suppose I’ve either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you’re listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there’s not much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well.  Hello."
Hi.
"Ross, I love you!"
Ohh! Thank you.
"Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?"
"Yes, at 4:00."
"Okay, thank you. That’ll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us."
I’d better get back to my desk.
"Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation."
Pheebs?
Yeah?
Do you remember where the duck food is?
"Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?"
Because I’m going to London.
What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?
"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back."
"I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!"
"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision."
"That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."""
Ohh—Do you think he will?!
"No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know, it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over."
"Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, ""I do."""
"I do! I do! I do!  I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter."
"Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this."
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
Melissa!
"You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what’s up with you?!"
Wh——Why don’t I tell you over here?
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
"Oh no-no, no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!"
Shut up!
I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear!
"Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?"
Oh please…
Are you?!
No.
"Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?"
"Oh tomorrow, oh I don’t know. Um…"
You do now. You’re having dinner with me.
Shut up.
"I-I’ve got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here’s my card."
"Oh, wow thanks! Oh you’re in real estate!"
"Oh no, that’s-that’s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference."
Wow! What do you do now?
I’m a party planner. I’ll see you tomorrow.
Okay!
Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray!
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
"She seems really, really fun!"
She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
"Wait a minute, she isn’t… She’s not the one who you…"
Who you what? Who you what?!
Yes.
Wow!
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you—what?!!
It’s not a big deal!
They were lovers.
What?!
What?!
"No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit."
So that’s two of my wives.
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Hey!
You did it! You got ordained?!
"Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!"
Our minister…
"Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons."
What did you get?
USA Today
"Nice, put it with the others."
And I also got... two more apples.
"We are four short of a bush-o. God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!"
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
"Oh, that's not cool."
"Dude, none of this is cool."
"No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through."
"I think I know what you mean though... the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs... oh, you already got that."
"Not my first time in a hotel, my friend."
"Ok, how about this?"
"No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!"
"Yes, but the batteries..."
"Thank you, thank you very much!"
Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
No!
At least tell me where you hid it.
"Hey, so how is it?"
I broke my thumb.
"Your thumb, that's weird, you sure you're punching right? Make a fist. Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible."
"You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms."
"You, you want me to help you with that?"
"Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?"
"Name? I know Ross but what's it short for? You know like, like Rossle or Rosstepher."
Just Ross
"It's pretty, OK date of birth?"
You know my birthday.
"Sure, Maytember."
October 18th.
Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Actually I'm a palian?Dinosaurs is fine?the drawing is not.
"Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?"
"Ah, Rachel I guess."
"OK, relationship, boy this could take a while."
Just ah?just put roommate.
"Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you're gonna get together right?"
I don't think that we are.
But you two were supposed to be together.
"Well, I thought so too, then she said she'd marry you."
"Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody."
Yeah that's what she said
So?
So I don't wanna be just anybody.
Wow.
"You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway, I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid."
Really?
Yeah.
And you're OK with that?
"Yes. I mean, it's what we always planned, and if you have a plan, you should stick to it, that's why they call them plans, hello, I'm fine."
"Hey, for what it's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just ""anybody""."
Hey there you go!
"""thanks"""
"Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?"
"Dr. Franzblau, hi."
"So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?"
"Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus."
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
"59 seconds. Quartz, ha."
"Swiss quartz, ha, ha."
Am I allowed to drink anything?
"Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station."
I'll get it.
"No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back."
I got it—I'm getting it!
"Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips."
Thanks.
"And if you need anything else, I——do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate."
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
"Oh, that's funny!"
"Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!"
Hi.
Hi!
Hi
"Yeah, she's gonna live with me!"
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
"I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!"
"So, uh, wh-where ya from?"
"Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago."
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
"So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?"
I'm a dancer.
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
"Well, I think I'll go and unpack."
"Oh, hey let me."
"Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?"
Of course I did.
"Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?"
"""When can you move in?"""
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Unbelievable
"Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana."
"So, uh, how's she doing?"
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
"How-how are you, Mom?"
"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?"
What?
What's different?
Nothing.
"Oh, maybe that's it."
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
"I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah...."
"It's not funny, this is actually my job."
"Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus."
"Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger."
"Ah, just one other thing."
Yes?!
"I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?"
Do you want my pickle?
Hey!
Hi!
You ready?
Yeah.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
"Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier."
Let me see the earrings.
"Oh, honey, the earrings…"
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
"All right, that's it, I quit."
What? I didn't say anything.
"Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
How who wears it?
Demi Moore.
Demi Moore is not a he.
"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten."
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
"Oh, oh, oh my god!"
Oh my god!
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?"
"She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost."
"Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
I KNOW!
"Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?"
Yes!
"Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!"
"Pheebs, that’s great!"
"Oh, yay!"
"But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle."
I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
"All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?"
Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Oh yeah!
"Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?"
Hey!
Hey!
"So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and…"
What is DOOL?
"Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!"
Oh!!
That’s great!
"And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!!"
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
"Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?"
"Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body."
What? A brain transplant?!
"Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure."
It’s ridiculous!
Who are they killing off?
"Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart."
Noo!!
She’s my favorite character on DOOL.
Nice.
"She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage."
And the way she slaps all the time!
Oh!
Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?!
Don’t do it.
"Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress."
"Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes."
"Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the ""brain transplant,"" you are going to be her?"
"Yes, but in Drake Remoray’s body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!"
"Okay, Phoebe…"
Yes! Your honor?
"We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, ""I do"" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!"
"When Monica was a little girl, I remember that——Ooh!! Ow! Very good!"
Oh!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
"Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…"
Go!
"Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as… Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old."
Oh! That’s nice.
"Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey."
Wow. Good speech.
"Yeah, it really was!"
"Aw, thanks!"
"Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next although I really don’t see the point."
Yeah.
"Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked."
And she’s back in the game.
"Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?"
"Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift."
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
"Ross, you stay here and talk, I’m gonna go have a baby."
"Okay. Okay. Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I’m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car."
Right! We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you. So in just a minute…
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I’m sorry, semi-private? We, we asked for a private room."
"Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we can’t guarantee a private room and currently they’re all unavailable."
"Man, if only you’d gotten here sooner."
I’m sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
Yeah?
Give her some money.
I really think they’re out of rooms.
"They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!"
"Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble, you don’t know where any countries are. Okay. Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have opened up?"
This is a hospital.
Okay. Y’know what? I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa! Oh gosh! Whoa!
What-what?
Ow! Ow! Contraction. Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Would you like to see a semi-private room?
"Yeah, it couldn’t hurt to look."
"All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes."
"Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl."
I wish I didn’t have to go.
"Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one more day."
"Ohh, Ross, please!"
"One more day, seriously."
"Don’t do this to me, again. You’d know I’d stay here in a minute, but I’d really miss so much work, they’ll fire me."
"So, then you can stay as long as you want."
I wish I could.
"Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on!"
Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Do you realize you get louder each week?
There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
"I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow."
"Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding."
"Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?"
No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.
Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?
Let’s just do it right now. Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart.
"Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door."
Yo- hooo!
Where the hell've you been?
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Are you drunk?!
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
"Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried..."
Monica? Monica!
Water rules!
"Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?"
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!"
"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!"
"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people."
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
What?
They've arrested Monica.
Hey.
Hey.
So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
"Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so it’s got a bit of a kick."
Are you okay?
"Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah, I’m uh; I’m better than great. I am good. And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y’know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y’know? I like being on my own, I’m uh, better off this way. I’m uh, a lone wolf. Y’know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What’s a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!"
"Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?"
"He'll be here OK, take a chill pill."
"I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late."
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
"Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass."
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Doubtful.
"Jack, give me that. Talk to your son."
"Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux."
"Dad, she won't want to go with me."
"Of course she would, you're a college man."
I don't know.
"Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?"
"I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh."
OK. Hold my board.
Atta boy.
"What's up? Hey, Rachel!!"
Oh!
"No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these ""big massage places""! They're putting people like me out of business!"
"And she wants to go hunting, too!!"
"Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!"
"Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells."
I don't care about any of that!!
"Well, do you care about friendship?"
Oh!
"I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend."
"Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!"
Promise?
I promise.
Thank you.
But I am going hunting!!
Rachel?
Yeah.
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
You would think.
"Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice."
What?!
"Gunther, I quit."
Where are Bill and Colleen?
They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
We have to leave!!
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
"I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him."
"Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!"
Hey.
"Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen."
"I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet."
But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
I'm adopted?!
See? Intuitive!
What? Where did you hear that?
He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
Which technically now you should give back!
You told him he's adopted?
"I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."""
He isn't?!
"We have to get out of here, baby!"
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
"Oh, you get used to it."
"Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things."
"So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?"
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Oh.
"Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?"
What?
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
"Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir."
Excuse me?
"Well, I just…"
"Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke."
Really?
"Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?"
"I think I do! Thank you, Monica."
I thought you could use the help.
Coffee in a fight!
Hey.
Hey.
"I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were."
"Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!"
"All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again."
"Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child."
"Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react."
"Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin."
Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!
He’s not?
"No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont."
Why?
He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.
"Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him. It’s just it’s Rachel, y’know?"
"Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend."
"Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him."
"All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money."
"Hey, Danny!"
Hey! What's going on?
"Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?"
Salad.
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
Bread. Aren't you a chef?
Oh.
Hey! Rachel!
"Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party."
"Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it."
"Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime."
"Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back."
"Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?"
I thought there wasn't a ball?
"Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!"
"Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about."
"Oh, go on! You telling people about me?"
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
"So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies."
"Hey, what did your agent say?"
"Yep, this kiss thing is definitely a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me."
"What, forget it!"
"Yeah, right."
"Come on, I need your help here."
"All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again."
"You see this, this is a friend."
"Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend."
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
"Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on."
"Yeah, that makes sense."
Over my dead body!
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Kristen?
Joey!
Hi!
Hi! What are you doing here?
"Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking any rules so I…"
"Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross."
Hi!
Hi. It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Yeah. So…
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Hey Toby!
Hey Bobby.
"It’s Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing’s office is?"
"Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?"
"I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is."
"Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here."
Toby don’t.
Bob!
Toby! I’m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
Well that puts me in a difficult position.
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
"Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!"
"Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for."
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Monica!
Op! We gotta go!
"Oh, where are you guys going?"
We’re gonna pick up the wedding dress then we’re gonna have lunch with mom.
Ah. Joey you’re-you’re having lunch with my mom?
"No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!"
Whoa! Big octopus.
"Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um."
"Hey, what kind of work do you do?"
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
"Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!"
"Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea."
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
You mean like watch?
"No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?"
"Well, I don't think this, y'know."
"No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?"
"Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?"
"Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!"
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
She broke my arm.
He touched my fanny.
"No, she touched mine first!"
That's my job!
"So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?"
Ewww!!!
You can't have sex with her!
"What'd you think I was, a hooker?"
"No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop."
"Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes."
Fine. I don't like you!!
"Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it."
"Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!"
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
"Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!"
"Hey, what's-what's going on?!"
"Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica."
Dude! He's right there!
"I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!"
"Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her."
"I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too."
"My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!"
"Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while."
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
"Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react."
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
"Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister."
"Hey, have you guys seen Monica?"
"Uh, actually I think she went to the salon."
"Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright..."
Check it out!
Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
What do you think?
I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
Don't you just love it?
Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
"You've never said that in your life, have you?"
Not once.
I thought so.
And listen to this...
What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Can you figure out what I’m doing?
You’re Lewis Posin.
Who?
"Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?"
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
"No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa…. And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie."
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
"No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me."
"Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!"
"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?"
No! He blew us off!
What?!
I know!
I can’t believe it. Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
"Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!"
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
That’s right!
I like it!
Eh? We’ll show him!
"From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler."
"Dude, don't do that too me!"
"All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind."
"No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister."
Hey!
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
"Well, I do."
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
"Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?"
"I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch."
"No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!"
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
"Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!"
"Dude, we are sooo gonna party!"
"Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?"
"Mike ""Gandolf"" Ganderson, only like the funniest guy in the world."
I’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
I’m gonna call after you!
"This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!"
Woooo!!!
"I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?"
"It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill."
I'm still all those things!
You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
I am scrappy.
"Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in."
It's because I'm scrappy.
"Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you."
I won't know what I would do without you.
"Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda."
"Yeah, I guess you're right."
Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
"That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!"
"Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?"
"Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys…"
May I help you?
"Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago."
"Oh right, uhm, Don?"
Close. Ron.
Uh... What can I do for you?
"Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back."
"Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?"
"Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back."
"Wow, that is tempting."
"Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?"
She is good!
"Huh, I took a shot there."
"But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do."
I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son?
"Yeah, his name is Ross. What?"
"Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?"
"Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?"
"How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!"
You can really arrange that?
"You let Rachel come back, and it’s done."
"Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world."
"Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life."
"That’s great. I worry about little Ross. He’s always reading, he's collecting rocks and he’s obsessed with dinosaurs."
He’ll be fine.
"Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?"
"Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big"
You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Kinda. They’re really big.
Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?
What?
"Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?"
"No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating."
"Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?"
"Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid even more sweating."
Even with me?
"I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives."
Really?
"Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts, I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink."
"Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don’t have to worry. No, besides y’know what? I’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid…"
Water! Water! Water!
"Rach, you there?"
"Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?"
"Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant.  That's not nonchalant!"
No idea what it means.
"Oh... okay, just hide!"
Rach?
"Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!"
There's no room under the bed.
Is everything okay?
Yeah...
Hey.
Hi...
You know where Joey is?
...I really don't...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
"Yeah, sure..."
I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
"You okay there, slugger?"
"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine."
What is with you tonight?
Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
"Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it."
No. It's the one he's licking.
She's supposed to be with you.
You're good.
"Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?"
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
"No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off."
When?
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
"No, it's you!"
Please.
"No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy..."
Right.
"You are gonna be fine, believe me."
Heeey!
Hi!
"Come on in, how are ya?"
I'm good!
Can I offer you a drink?
"Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book..."
"Uh-oh. I had a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go ohhhh!"
So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
"Hey, if you need a tour guide..."
"Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!"
"Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?"
"Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall."
Ok!
And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
"I know, yeah!"
"And first, I have to see the MET!"
"Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees."
"No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!"
"Which one, they all suck!"
The museum!
I don't think so.
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
"Uh, can I talk to you a minute?"
Sure.
This is really hard for me to say.
"Oh God, you fell off the wagon."
"Oh, no, no, it's about you."
What about me?
I think you may have a drinking problem.
"What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes."
"Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?"
Oh... shoot.
"Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends."
OK.
Take care.
You too.
What happened?
Well we... we kinda broke up.
Awwwwwwww.
"Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?"
"Yeah, of course, Donald."
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
What?!
"Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental."
Yeah.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
"Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich."
A sandwich?
"Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…"
"Oh, you know what?"
What?
"I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that."
You ate my sandwich?
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
No.
Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
That said it was my sandwich?!
"Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash."
What?
"Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away."
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Ross?
Hey Chandler. Monica!
"Ross, are you okay?"
I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Why?!
On account of my rage.
"Which I may say, right now, is out of control."
He gave me a pill for it.
A pill?
"Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it."
"Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?"
And you're okay with that?
"I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich."
So what're you going to do?
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
"Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef."
Um... hi there.
"Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so...."
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
"Yeah, yeah!"
"Well, what kind of food is he looking for?"
"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu."
Oh my God!
"Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?"
"Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Time is money my friend?
"Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'"
"Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?"
"Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50."
How did you make $17.
"Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY."
How come those?
"Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy."
"What happened to uh, MEG.?"
"MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down."
That is so not my motto.
"Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend."
"Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore."
"No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!"
"Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's."
"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back."
"Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail..."
Make the transfer!
Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago."
"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy."
But he's the same.
"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back."
But he's the same.
"Joey, come on!"
He's the same!
You're not the same!
"A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation."
"Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen."
And where is your hat?
"It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it."
"Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I’m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘cause—Oh! I’m pregnant!"
"Pheebs, did…you want a cookie?"
Thank you so much.
"So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?"
I haven’t really had any yet.
"Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome."
"Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio."
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
"Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome."
"That's all right, Rache, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?"
What up?!
"Everyone, this is Julie."
Julie.
Ohh.  Hi!
"Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me."
And bus.
Oh my god.
The screaming guy?
And the spitting?
You gotta hear this story.
"We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old..."
At least.
...and this guy--
"And the chicken poops in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about."
"This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?"
"Well, Ross and I were in grad school together."
"But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig."
"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
It's an expression.
"Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby."
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
"Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time."
"Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised."
"Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?"
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
"Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!"
"Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?"
"Well, I suppose I could give him a warning."
"Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose."
Did you get your money back?
"Yeah, 15 hundred dollars."
Wow! You made a profit!
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
"Oh yeah, there you go."
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
"Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind."
Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
"Oh, I-I don’t eat meat."
It’s chicken.
"Yeah, I don’t eat that either."
"I’ll never understand you lesbians. So baby, tell me…what is new with you."
Well actually umm…
Your ’74 Lafite sir.
’74?! I ordered the ’75! That’s a magnificent wine! The ’74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?! Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you’re a waiter?
This is why I told the manager I wouldn’t wait on you tonight!
Oh come on! Don’t be such a baby!
Hi guys!
"Hey, Pheebs! Hi!"
"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?"
"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'"
Ohh. Ouch.
"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?"
"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'."
Since when?
"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'."
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'."
And everybody knows this?
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."
"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm."
"Uh, Ross."
"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!"
Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.
What?
I have a gun.
"O-ok. Just relax, Phoebe, just stay calm. Oh my god, I can't find my wallet."
"Alright, lady, now give me your purse!"
No.
"What do you mean ""no""? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay."
"Lowell, is that you?"
Phoebe? Oh my god!
Oh my god!
"I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross."
"Ross, nice to meet you."
"Yeah, a real pleasure."
"Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this!"
"Oh, I know, but I quit smoking!"
Good for you!
So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?
Uh-huh.
"Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?"
"Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up..."
I'm dead and no one cares?
I look like a man??
"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
"It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!"
"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?"
"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?"
Yeah...
Our little boy is getting married.
Oh look at you! So handsome!
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I’m so glad you here.
Are you Chandler?
Are you Joey?
Hey Gunther.
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
"Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go."
Do you still work here?
"No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I’m sorry."
"Oh that’s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway."
Great!
Trick or treat!
Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go!
My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
"Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we’ve got candy."
I’d rather have the money.
"Well, that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween!"
This isn’t fair.
Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
Shut up!
You shut up!
You can’t tell me to shut up!
"Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!"
Rach?
"Yeah I know—I’m good—I got it! Now wait a minute, I’ve got one more thing I have to say to you…oh right! Shut up!"
You’re a mean old woman.
No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
"Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card."
"Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my ""Please, hire me"" sweater. And these are my, ""Don’t you want to rent me this apartment?"" pants."
I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
"Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!"
"Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea."
So who made her queen of the world?
I would love that job!
"All right, I’m here, let’s ahh, get this over with."
": Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead."
"Whoa-whoa, don’t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?"
": Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh."
: Ahhhh! I’m sorry!
"No, it’s okay, but if I’m Marge, my breasts are coming out my back."
": Ahh, forget it! I’ll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I’m just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head."
"Come on man, you’re not a potato."
": I’m sure as hell a dancer, it’s no use Marge will never go for me."
"Come on Treeger, don’t say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y’know, I’m not really that comfortable dancing with a—We-he!! Hey!"
: Yeah!
"Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
Sure. What's up?
"Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!"
Rach? Hi!
Hi!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Well yeah…
"Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!"
Really?!
"Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!"""
Oh so-so not really never.
"I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through, I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing."
"Oh-ho, and mine!"
"No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen."
What do you mean?
"Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly.."
"Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!"
"It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel."
"Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?"
"That's what I hear, yeah."
"This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?"
"Come on, I mean, you know me, you know..."
Joey.
I'm crazy about her.
And she feels the same way?
I think so.
"Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on."
"Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it."
"No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?"
"No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?"
"Yeah, I'm sure."
And we're okay?
"Uhh, Rachel, my parents…"
Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
"Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries."
"What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so… And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, ""USA not ready."""
Maybe in L.A?
Yes!
There you go.
"So, have you kids eaten yet?"
"Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next."
"Well, we’re starving, why don’t we all go get something to eat?"
"Oh, yeah, well… Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’ around the house."
So… We go eat.
Yes.
"You’ll wear that. We’ll be eating, and of course, you’ll be wearing that."
"Bing! We’re all set for tonight, 8 o’clock."
"Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work."
"Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then."
Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
Oh? Why not?
It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
"What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?"
Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.
So why can’t the three of us go out together?
Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
"Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust."
Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
"Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this. Now here’s the plan, grab your coat, we’re going to a strip club."
"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch."
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
"Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?"
"Yeah, they’re fine."
Yeah?
"If anyone asks, we’ll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?"
Sure. Why not?
Really?
Yeah?
I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
"Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?"
"Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it’s absolutely your decision. More tea?"
Yeah sure.
Earl Grey?
"Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want."
I'm gonna go.
Why?
I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.
Oh...you don't have to go...I have something that will fit you.
I put that tube top on as a joke.
I want you to stay.
I want to stay too but I've got about as much out of these boxers as I can.
Why don't you turn them inside out?
Done it. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
I'll miss you.
Me too.
You know what? I just realized something. I don't wanna go home.
Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
"No, no! What I mean is...I hate going back to my apartment now...And partly because I live above a known crack den but...mostly because when I'm there...It's just...i really miss you. So...Do you want to move in together?"
"Wow...Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say ""Hell yeah!""."
So we're doing it?
Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together!
Oh god...We're really going to move in together!
Yeah!
Thank you!
"Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?"
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you!
"Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?"
"I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash."
If you want I could loan you some money?
"Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore."
"Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?"
You could do that?
"Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need."
"Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!"
"Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think."
"Oh, really?"
No it is awesome!
Hey!
What’s wrong Mon?
"Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me."
Oh.
"I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef’s hat."
"Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’"
"Hey, honey! What’s the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!"
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Ohhh!
"I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life."
"Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?"
"I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation."
"Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss."
"Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?"
"That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?"
Good enough to get fired.
"All right, you’re hired!"
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Yes.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
This will be your phone.
"That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls."
No you answer it and take pledges.
But I'm the host!
"No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones."
"You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray."
"Well, here's your phone doctor."
Hi!
Wait! You’re supposed to wear a costume!
"I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won’t be able to fit into it."
Oh.
Ahh!
"I’m Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you’re too big for it."
Okay.
Hey!
Hi! Hey!
Do you guys know any cute guys?
"Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here."
"Oh, I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler."
"Anyway, there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go…"
What’s the charity?
"I don’t know, something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles a lot."
Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention?
Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
"Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?"
"Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux."
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Ooh! So close.
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.
"Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s."
"Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer."
"Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple."
"You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry."
"Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing."
Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
"When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear. I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know why I said that."
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.
"No thanks, Josephine."
"Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake."
"Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!"
"Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!"
Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
"We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!"
"We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday."
"So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged."
"Oh yeah, I should probably call them."
I remember when we first got engaged.
"Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story."
"Oh dad, really you don’t need to…"
Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?
"Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy."
"Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!"
That’s a good idea for a business!
"I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, ""So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?"" And she’ll go, ""No-no-no, it’s Chandler."" And he’ll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
That-that is a good trick.
"All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?"
"Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them."
"Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger."
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Yeah.
"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood."
They’re not a couple!
"Oh-okay, I get the game now."
"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?"
Oh yeah!
"Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble."
Really?
"Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?"
No.
Noooo!!
"So-so, what do you want for lunch?"
"Oh, I don’t know. I guess we have to eat."
"Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?"
I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
"Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…"
Still in love with?!
Yeah!
I’m not in love with Ross!
"Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither."
"Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!"
We thought you knew!
We?!
"Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!"
You all know? Does Ross know?
"Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything."
"Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!"
"Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."""
"Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt."
"Oh, ah, you don't need that."
Why not?
"The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness."
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
"Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really."
"Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that."
I know.
"Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?"
"Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't."
"Nothing I do means anything, really."
"This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right."
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
"Alright, we'll just, uh, see you when you get here. Bye. Huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic."
"Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma."
"Oh, what were the other two?"
"Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going."
"I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ... hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ... but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids."
She is?
Yeah.
What about Monica.
"Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso was a terror."
I just don't think I can bear it.
"Rachel, I know that you can. And you should."
Umm.
"Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I'll wait for my mom, and then I'll meet you there."
"Oh, ah..."
"No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red."
You need to learn some new slang.
"I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here. No, uh-uh, just go."
Wait ... Oh!
"No! No, you know what? You're not going back in there, the baby's fine, now scram. Yeah, tell your story walking."
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
"Oh, Holy moly, are we in a pickle now."
"Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower."
Ok.
"I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget."
"Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?"
What's up?
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
But what about Phoebe?
"Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around."
"Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her."
Uh--
"Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?"
"Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed."
Can I ask you something?
"Uhh, no."
"Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."" Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?"
No.
"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?"
Yes.
Thanks man.
Okay man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
"Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?"
I did.
"All right, let’s get me back up there!"
No! It don’t go up on the wall!
What—But you saw the show!
"Yes, it was very offensive to my people!"
Dry cleaners?
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
"Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!"
"That’s right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!"
"Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that’s offensive to Russians."
I’ve never seen it!
"Oh you should, it’s great."
"Oh, hey Joey."
"Uh, hey."
"Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison."
Yeah.
"Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday."
So he can't come?
"No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it."
Seriously?
"Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom..."
I am pretty wisdomous.
So... what do you say?
"Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored."
"Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me."
"Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!"
"Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!"
Luck!
"Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?"
"Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…"
"Unwilling to steal from work, interesting."
"Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me."
"Okay guys, way to wish me luck!"
Good luck! Go get 'em!
Hey guys!
"Hey, let me tell them!"
Sure.
Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Great!
Really? Which one?
"Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship."
"Things you find in the ocean, You're gonna be on ""Pyramid""!!"
"Oh, that was our favorite game show ever!"
"Except for ""Match game""..."
"Or ""Win, Lose or Draw""."
What did I marry into?
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
"Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party."
"Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing."
"Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond."
Seriously?
Yeah-uh!
Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
"Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends."
"Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out."
"""I'm a little bit country""..."
"""...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll""!"
I'm leaving you.
Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
"I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. Hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..."
"I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones."
Why?
"well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me."
"Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?"
"Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek..."
"That's fine, thank you."
Next.
"Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."
Name?
Holden McGroin.
Hey!
Hey!
"Hey—ooh so, how was Vermont?"
"Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!"
"Oh, hey!"
Hey! You were so right!
What?
"Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other."
"Oh, hmm."
"I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy…"
Joshua.
"Joshua…guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda…y’know."
"Yeah, I…"
But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally where you are!
"Oh, thank goodness!"
"Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily."
"Oh, no problem. I’m so glad I could help. Happy for you."
Happy for you.
"No, happy for you!"
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Oh my God.
Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!
"Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God, I thought… Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?"
Yes.
Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
Come in! Come in! We’re engaged!!!
... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Thank you!
"Oh, thanks guys!"
I thought... it was wonderful!
Oh!
"Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... ."
Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
"Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?"
"Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?"
"Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive."
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it."
Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department.
"Oh my God, are you out of a job?"
"No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!"
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Uh-huh.
That sounds great!
What are you guys gonna do?
"Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?"
"Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free."
"Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment."
An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.
"Oh-oh, that’s your thing."
What?
You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.
Oh yeah!
"No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!"
"Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I’m so drunk."
"…which brings us back of course to Greely’s theory of dominance. Okay, that-that’s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?"
"Yeah, it’s the new building on Avenue A."
"What?! That-that’s all the way cross town, I’m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes."
"Ooh, dude. That’s not gonna happen."
Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!
"Hello. I’m sorry I’m a little late. Ah——Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. So to sum up, I’m Professor Geller. Good job today."
"Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?"
"Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?"
The one in the director's chair.
"Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me."
"OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?"
"Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?"
We've got a problem.
Tell me.
I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
Is it bad?
"It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan."
I'll talk to her.
I hate actors.
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
Hello darlings.
And there’s daddy!
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Yay!
"Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!"
"No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!"
"I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?"
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
"Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?"
All right.
All right.
"Okay. ""It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out."" Ross"
Hey man.
What is up?
"About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry."
"No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted."
"Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest… But we had our best friend's interest at heart."
Could I be more sorry.
"I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry."
I'm sorry too.
"Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going."
"I am sorry, Chandler."
"I am sorry, Ross."
"A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end."
This took you all day?!
"No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!"
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
"Hello, Chip."
"Hey, Rach! How ya doin’?"
"I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I’m not seeing anyone right now, I’ve never felt better about myself."
"So ah, Monica ready yet?"
"She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?"
"Amy Welch? Wow! I haven’t seen her since... So, Monica about ready?"
Hey!
"Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?"
"Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!"
You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
"Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going."
Ugh! Women!
"I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""So, where is this going?"""
Uh Ross? You asked me that.
"Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it."
Like asking her to move in with you?
Smaller than that.
Making her a mixed tape?
"Uh, bigger than that."
Give her a key to your apartment.
Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
"All right. Have you said, ""I love you?"" You could say, I love you."
"Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you."
"No, we hate that."
That is a slap in the face.
"Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?"
"I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater."
Hey.
Hey.
"Listen, I um - I heard about the engagement."
Surprised?
"And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um - I didn't propose to you."
I know.
I don't think you do.
You didn't propose to me. Joey did.
"Poor baby, you're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you."
"Uh - You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did."
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins—stop it —now. What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Big fat goalie.
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
Dangerous Liaisons.
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Weekend at Bernie’s.
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Oh!
"Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?"
Everyday use.
Fancy.
Guest.
Fancy guest.
Two seconds…
"Uhh, 11!"
"11, unbelievable 11 is correct. All right, that’s 4 for the guys. Ladies, you’re up."
All right!
Come on!
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins…now! What is Joey’s favorite food?
Sandwiches!
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
14?
"No, 19."
Thanks man.
"Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?"
Maurice.
"Correct, his profession was?"
Space cowboy!
Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
"Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers."
And processing.
He carries a briefcase.
"10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game."
"It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding."
"Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!"
That’s not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Oh my God.
YEAH!!! YES!!!
"Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s."
Still?
"I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance."
I don’t see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
"Either eat it, or be in it."
"Spoon? So, what do you think?"
"I’m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal."
Hey!
Hey!
"You’ll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn’t even tell me why!"
Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
"Y’know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work."
"It’s not random, it’s Bob."
It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn’t like the way I dress—No that can’t be it. It’s really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I’m so stupid! I’m just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
"No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to."
You asked him too?!
Hm-mmm.
Why?!
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…
"I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross?"
No.
"You don’t want him, but you don’t want me to have him?"
Y’know Bob in Human Resources…
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
"Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just…"
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Why are you so jealous of me?
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!
"Can’t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can’t have is dairy!"
"All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!"
Who?!
In Human Resources!!!!!!
"Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!"
What’s the matter?
"Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for."
So do them for free.
"Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse."
They make you take an oath?
"No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense."
Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?
"No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional."
"Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?"
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!
You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!
I don’t what your talking about.
Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Wow! This place is beautiful!
Look at all these paleontologists!!
"I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!"
"Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!"
"I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!"
"Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!"
That... never happens...
"I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech."
"Wow! This is very flattering, uh..."
I would love your autograph.
"Uh, uh... Sure! Um... ""Dear..."""
Sarah.
"""... Sarah. I dig you"", Uh? ""Doctor Ross Geller""."
Thank you so much!
"Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani."
Are you a paleontologist?
"No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""The Days of Our Lives""."
"Dude, it's just ""Days of Our Lives""... there's no the."
"Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray."
"I'm sorry, I don't own a TV."
You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
You told her!
Nancy Thompson’s getting fired!
"Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I choose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said, ""Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"""
"You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn’t be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!"
How could you tell her?!
I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Du-ude!
What happened in Atlantic City?!
"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar…"
"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""
"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls."
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard…"
"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
"Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily..."
"I, Emily..."
Take thee Ross...
Take thee Ross...
"As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, till death parts us."
"As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us."
"Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross..."
I Ross...
"Take thee, Emily..."
"Take thee, Rachel...Emily.  Emily."
Uhh...Shall I go on?
"Oh, hello."
"Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh..."
Is everything ok?
"Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today."
Oh my god.
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman."
"Oh, honey."
"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far."
What do you mean?
I think it went into me.
"Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up."
Let’s go watch it at your place.
"Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny."
"Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses."
"What? No, I want to watch this. Did your cable go out?"
"No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know…"
"Joey, why is your cable out?"
"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill"
"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?"
"No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot."
Whoa ho.
"I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book."
"All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?"
Sure.
Paid your phone bill?
Not so much.
"Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this."
I’m not?
"Listen I uh… It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom. Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y’know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me?"
What?
What?!
What?!!
"Pheebs, give me the ring back!"
No!!
"No! Joey, oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet, honey. But I’m not, I’m not looking for a husband."
I understand.
"Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down."
I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
"Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered…"
Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
There you go!
Hey guys.
Hey!
"So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?"
"Ahh, no, I’m good."
"Okay, I’ll see you in a bit."
"Okay, have fun! Wooo!!"
"Come on see, she doesn’t look that bad."
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
I don’t know.
"You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!"
"All right! Ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with somebody else?"
"Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?"
"Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!"
You still love me?
Noo.
You still love me.
"Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!"
"Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
"Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so..."
What?!
"I just, I feel, I-I just..."
What?
I feel…
Hey!
"Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?"
Nope.
"No? What happened, big guy?"
"""Big guy?"""
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
I got fired.
Oh!
"Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and..."
"Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell."
My mom will.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
"Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!"
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
"Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?"
"Hard to tell, I was naked."
"No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'."
Yeah? That's so nice!
"Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?"
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
"Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white."
What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
Ooh... she backed out.
She did? Why?
"I made her. Steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding"". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent."
Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
"I’m so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it’s like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we’re gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef."
"Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?"
Hi honey!
"Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!"
"Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!"
You too.
"You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer."
I got it.
Thanks.
"So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?"
"Yeah, I guess."
"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
Excuse me?
"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!"
"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!"
"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out."
Chandler!
"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!"
I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
Ok!
Uh!
Zack!
Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
"Tell me about yourself, Zack!"
"Alright, here you go, sweetie."
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
"Oh God, yes!"
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
That is funny.
"I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village."
"Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?"
Oh yeah. See you guys.
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Oh.... my... God.
It's not that bad.
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
"OK, OK, don't get all squinky."
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
"But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me."
"Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free."
"Well umm, y'know, I used to play."
"Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?"
"Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound."
"Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound."
Yeah.
"He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was ever allowed to hear, ""The Sound."""
"I wanna hear ""The Sound."""
"Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?"
"Come on, play that funky music white boy."
Yeah!
"No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in -- No, yeah, okay."
We're seriously asking for our money back?
"It's for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting."
Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don't think that that's ever happened before.
"Gay, go."
"Oh my God, I love your shirt!"
"The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back."
Excuse me?
"Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn't want, but it turns out we do."
So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children?
Yeah! This feels really good.
"I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me."
"Hey, it's not my business, besides it's probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing…"
"Hey, that's not fair! A person's wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn't have a graduation party! And I didn't go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it."
She could have been talking about either one of us.
Hi!
Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
How come?
"Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it."
What do you do with your money now?
"Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!"
Do you have any ideas?
"Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitching in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus..."
Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
"Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: ""Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird. "" Or... or maybe just a wing or..."
"Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment. The Fed just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. That's right, I know some stuff!"
"Real estate, huh? Hmmm..."
"Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!"
"Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!"
My dad told me. They play golf together.
"Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face."
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What?
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…
"I don’t know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night."
Yeah!
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!
Who got married?!
You did.
What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.
"No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!"
We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.
Oh my God.
I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
No!
"And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me."
Uh-huh... right... yeah...
And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
"Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you."
"Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?"
"That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say."
"You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace."
You would think!
Hey Pheebs!
Hey Phoebe!
"Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town."
"I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!"
Who's Amanda?
"She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message.  ""Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"""
Are you trying to do a British accent?
Chandler gets pedicures!
"Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?"
"You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? ""Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!"" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"""
"I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met."
"Oh, I know! ""Oh...I slept with Billy Joel"". All right, who hasn't?"
"Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!"
"Ugh, Let's just cut her out!"
What?
Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
"Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! Have you ever done that?"
"No, had it done to me though. Feels good !"
"Hey, what's all this stuff?"
"Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies."
"Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!"
That's not really how it works.
"Oh, how does it work?"
I don't know!
"Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you."
"Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?"
Hey! How'd the interview go?
"Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me."
"Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out."
This is the worst Christmas ever.
"Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house."
"I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans."
That word was swans.
Hey.
"Hey, how's the first day goin'?"
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Well there you go.
"Hey and everybody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie."
"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?"
"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?"
Weird world. Your kids?
I figure my character has kids.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does."
"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes."
"Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did."
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
"All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?"
"My son? Pretty serious. Oh hey Katie! What uh, what are you doing here?"
"Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this."
"Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store."
"Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description."
Oh.
Oh uh…I actually came here to ask you out.
"Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this back in my pocket, pretend that didn’t happen. Uh yeah, actually I’m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or…"
Sure!
Horny bitch. No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re the horny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch!
So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Emotional Knapsack?
Yeah.
"Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez."
"Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with her all night."
"Dude, don't do that too me!"
"Well, I feel like a snack!"
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.
Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
What?!
"Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories."
"Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots."
No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
How did you know about that?!
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Were you the ones called the cops?!
"That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding."
Why not?
Because we hate them.
Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!
We have heard you play.
"No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration."
Hey!!
"There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi. What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?"
"He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it."
"He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret."
"Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?"
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
"This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?"
"You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I."
"Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?"
Rach?
Yeah?
The bathroom?
Right!
"I have no idea what you’re talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay’s autograph!"
"Oh, you’re Phoebe’s fan!"
Oh yeah! I’ve seen all her movies.
Movies?
"That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star."
I don’t think so.
"No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren’t gonna believe this!"
"Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a porn star!"
"Well, I wouldn’t call her a star, but she’s really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget."
Who is it?
It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!
Hey!
Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.
No I’m not.
We’re still rolling!
You’re making one right now!
Let’s go Phoebe!
And-and you’re using my name!
"Yeah, can I help you with something?"
"Phoebe, come on!"
"Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her."
"Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller."
What?!
"Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars."
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you with that!
Hi!
Do you have a minute?
"Well yeah, sure, what’s up?"
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch…by guys.
Oh really?!
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
"Oh, did you not want people to know that?"
But I’m not gay. And I especially wouldn’t want you to think I was gay.
Why’s that?
I don’t think I should say.
"Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things."
Okay.
‘Kay.
Well…
Yeah.
I’d love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
"Yeah, she’s gay."
Hi
Hey.
Oooh. Girl's night out indeed.
"Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross.. ."
"Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun."
Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye.
Bye.
So.. . Welcome.
I got beer.
I got bottled breast milk.
"Eh, why don't we start with the beer?"
"Okay. So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano."
Yeah.
"You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college."
Ah? Do you have one here?
No.
Okay.
"Um.. . ah.. . you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah.. . Phoebe said you.. . You've been divorced?"
"Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't.. . I don't really like to talk about it."
That's okay. We'll talk about something else.
"So, you're a paleontologist, right?"
Yeah.
My cousin's a paleontologist.
"Ah? Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about."
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
"Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please."
"""Heating device."""
Radiator.
Five letters.
Rdtor.
"Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman."
So she's a woman! So what?
"Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now!  Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like——Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally.."
Joey!!
"Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress."
The green dress? Really?
"Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day."
Nooo!
"A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!!  Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!"
No ma’am.
"Hey! He has a name, it’s Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat.  We did the hat right?"
Have you seen Chandler?
No. Why?
‘Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I’m not gonna have and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it.
"Okay, don’t sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute."
Phoebe! Come on I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
No that is the last thing you want to do!
Why?
Because you’re marrying him!
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
"All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband."
So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?
"That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight."
Your mother told you this?
Yes!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Oh my God! You’re right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love?
Hey Phoebe.
Hey. Everything ok?
I’m just mad at my agent.
Estelle? Why?
There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.
I’m guessing she does.
"Well. I’m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this."
"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her."
Ok. Why?
Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
I love that saying!
"Hey, Monica!"
"Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?"
"You had sex, didn't you?"
How do you do that?
"Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who?"
You know Paul?
"Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul."
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
"Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years."
Hi.
I didn't get a cat.
"Oh, that's um, interesting."
"No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting."
"Alright, I got it Ross."
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
What?
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
Then you should have said something before I met her.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
There was never a good time.
"Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night."
"Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys."
"Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?"
"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
"Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?"
"Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it."
"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
Fine.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Good.
Good.
"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk."
That’s kinda sad.
"Yeah, well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office."
Got it!
Let’s roll!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
"Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help."
We will.
"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles."
"No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this."
Every year.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
"Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something."
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
"Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad."
At least I care about his feelings!
What?!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?
And why wouldn't he get it?
"Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!"
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
You just give him a spoon baby!
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
You're kid's name is Raymond!
Yeah?! So's yours!
"Hey dude, what's up?"
"Don't judge me, I'm only human!"
Did you take that tape?
"I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?"
I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
Some girl...!?
She hot?
Yeah...!?
How did she get me to settle down?
"All right, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?"
"Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya..."
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
What? Whoo... What?
"Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?"
"All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame..."
Why am I hearing cheering?
"Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game."
Football? Just football?
"Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing."
It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?
You don't wanna see what I just saw!
"What are you guys doing? Oh my God, is that Richard?"
Hi!
Hi.
"Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote."
"I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch."
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
"You're kidding! Oh, I love him."
"Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've..."
Oh please!
"So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class."
"Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out."
"That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him."
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Is it on?
"No, but this wonder broom is amazing!"
Hey!
Oh my God!
Oh! It's on! It's on!
Hey guys!
Hey!
Yeah!
"Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!"
What?!
Are you serious?!
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
"You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We…"
"Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?"
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
And then... your face is bloated?
"No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?"
You said you'd marry Joey?
"OK, you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married. I'm not helping."
"So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?"
That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
"So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend."
Well Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
"Well, Chandler's my oldest friend, but Joey's my NO! Ah!"
Ooooo!
"Hey I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye."
Rachel said she'd marry you!
"This isn't the right room, sorry folks."
"Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily…"
Oh my God! My dog died!
What?!
"Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!"
Le Poo's still alive?!
"Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine-teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God."
"Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry."
It's Le Poo.
"I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better."
"Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion."
You wanna what?!
"I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!"
What are you talking about?
"Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed."
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
"Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?"
My parents will be so happy.
"Hey, Sophie!"
"Hey, Rach!"
Hey.
Hey.
"Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here."
"Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem."
"Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?"
"Yes, I realise that."
Summer catalogue!
That's the stuff!
What are you doing tonight?
Huh? Uh…
Dude! Dude!
"Oh! Sorry. Uh, I’ve got those plans with Phoebe, why?"
"Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00."
What?! Tonight?!
That’s what Monica said.
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
You're gonna do what to my clocks.
I'm gonna set them to my time.
"Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time."
"No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?"
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
"No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now."
No come on. Come on tell me.
No. See you don't understand.
Come on.
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
No that's not true. That is not true.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
"Alright, well tell me one of yours."
"Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks."
What if they get mixed up?
"Boy I would just uh, I would freak out."
"You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing."
"See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well."
Hey.
Hey.
"I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!"
"No-no, I got that."
"So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?"
"Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour."
Okay.
I mean $500.
What?
600.
What’s going on?
"Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!"
What?
"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on."
What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I make!
Really? There’s nothing sexual about this? Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. What are you looking at?! I mean hi.
"Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get massaged again!"
"No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!"
Really?!
"Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it."
Are you sure?
Yes.
I guess.
"Great! Okay, if you’ll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?"
Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
"So, why are you still wearing it?"
"Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?"
Ooh... Not so good.
"Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?"
"Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse."
JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
"Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend."
"I pick you, Phoebe."
"Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs."
"Yeah, well, I kinda thought."
"Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?"
The show?!
"Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?"
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
"Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding!"
The wedding starts at six.
"Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there?"
You’ll vamp?!
"Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!"
"Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?"
"Uh why, do you have a lecture?"
"No, why?"
Then free as a bird. What’s up?
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
"Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask just anyone to play."
"Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you."
"Well, did-did you correct him?"
"No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way."
"This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week."
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
"Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win."
Yeah.
He hates to lose.
"Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand."
You’re not a lefty?
Does anybody know me?!
"Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me."
Hello Skidmark.
"It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later."
It’s pretty clear.
"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight."
That’s why you broke up with me?
"You-you-you didn’t know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!"
And why not?!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
You're-you're what?!
"Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica."
I love you too Chandler.
"I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!"
Dude!
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
God!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
"Well actually, Ross doesn't."
"Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
"God, what happened?!"
"Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!"
People are trying to sleep in here!
"Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts."
"Open it up, let me see."
"Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills."
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
"Ooh, God it looks bad."
"Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor."
"No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!"
He’s really picky about his patients.
"Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?"
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
"Hi! Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?"
Yes!!
Yes! She’s very excited about that.
Hello?
It's Phoebe.
And Rog.
C'mon up.
"Oh, good. Rog is here."
What's the matter with Rog?
Yeah.
"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."
"What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad."
"Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along."
Hey!
Hey!
"So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie."
Yeah?
"Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well..."
You kissed.
Wha... What? What would give you that idea?
I saw you.
"Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay."
"Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay."
What?
"It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy."
Are you serious?
Yeah... Now I have something...
"I am speechless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?"
Oh... uh... look... before you...
"No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous..."
"I am those things, yeah."
"You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff..."
Dude!
"Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you..."
I can't think of anything.
Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
"Okay, okay. But this is her last chance."
"Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
"Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?"
I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened."
What?
"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!"
"Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy."
…so I’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
"Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?"
Excuse me?
"Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too."
"Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I’m one of the people who thinks the smellier the better."
"Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house."
And you’re still married to him?
"You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries… And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s just I used to be fat."
"Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I’ve got a great little villa you can stay at."
Is it made of cheese?
"No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!"
I’d move in tomorrow!
Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
I’m so sorry.
What do we do?
"I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that."
"I’ll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy."
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
"Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye."
Dr. Burke will see you know.
"Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now."
"Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now."
Ready?
Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just so annoying; everywhere you go.
I think it’s coming from your bag.
I never get calls!! Hello?
"Hi, it’s Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula’s fiancée."
"Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how’d you get this number?"
"Oh, I have a friend who’s a cop and he got it for me."
Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.
"Uh listen, I just—I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula."
Oh you did? He did it! He did it!
Wow! What did he do?
Shhh! I’m talking.
"Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who…eats lunch."
Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
Yeah uh…okay. I’m-I’m sorry. Bye.
No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.
"Uhh, I won’t take no for an answer."
"Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours."
Great! But wh-wh—How do you know where I live?
"I’ve got friends too. Okay, bye."
Bye.
Hey!
Hey!
"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey."
"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea."
"Please, what about you and Chandler?"
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Well hello!
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!"
Alright. I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
I'm gonna do it.
And I can't stop you.
No.
"Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?"
"See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!"
You chipped in?!
"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars."
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
"Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be."
"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!"
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
"Oh hey, Pheebs!"
Hey!
"Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about."
"Yeah, okay, my bad."
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
"Okay, get ready to see some beggin’!"
"Oh, you came on to Ross!"
What?!
Now I’m so happy.
What are you talking about?!
You used the Europe story!
That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
How do you know about that story?!
How do you know about that story?!
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
Some guy!!
"No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams."
Ken Adams!!
"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll be uh, Mr. Wong."
Diverse.
Did anybody call for security?
You be cool.
"Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?"
Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
"Way to be cool, man."
What’s he talking about?
"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!"
"Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?"
Yeah!
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
"Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?"
Marry me.
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
Found it.
I'll take that dad.
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
"That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city."
"Dad, I'm the twinkie."
You're the twinkie?
She's not a twinkie.
"Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . ."
"Oh please, a relationship."
"Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man."
Really?
Yes.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
"Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier."
When did I say that?
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
"Morning, hey, you made pancakes?"
"Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."
"Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey."
Good morning.
"Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me."
"Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer."
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
"I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss."
"Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay."
Kiss her! Kiss her!
"I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey."
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
"Nope, not this time."
"Come on, quite yankin' me."
I'm not yanking you.
This is Janice.
"Yeah, I know. She makes me happy."
"Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking."
I'm not breaking up with her!
"Hi, Mike's place."
"Hey, it's Mike."
"Ooh, that was fast."
"Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone..."
"Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair. Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I."
One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
"Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up."
"Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout."
"Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?"
I... I'm Phoebe.
"Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?"
Enchanté
"Kim, hi."
"Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have."
Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah, he dumped me. He said, ""Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry."" And then I don’t know why but he said, ""and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."""
You expect me to believe..Hi Ralph.
Hi Kim.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s like he hates you. Then it is true.
Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.
Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We’ve all been there.
You and Ralph?
Kenny the copyboy.
"Umm, thank you for meeting with me."
Thank you. All right.
"Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay."
"Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm."
Okay.
"So, what did Francis leave me?"
Huh?
"Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?"
"Oh yes. Yes. Yeah—no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick."
"Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's—ew used. Umm, cool."
"Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?"
"Yes, yes I was."
"Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?"
It really says that?!
Yeah. See?
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
"Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?"
"Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm… Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?"
"Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!"
What is so funny about that?
"Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!"
Did you tell her what we talked about?
Yeah....
So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
"Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey."
Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
"Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks..."
"I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
"Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me."
Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!
Not knowing when to shut up...
Yep! That's my thing...
Earl! I’m Phoebe.
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
"Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself."
"Look, um I really appreciate your coming down…"
No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!
Why?!
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
I thought it was toner.
"No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself."
Really?!
Yes.
How?
I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Couldn’t it just be a coincidence?
"No, it’s fate!"
It doesn’t really seem like enough to be fate.
"Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager."
I’m actually the office manager.
"Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl."
"Well, was there anything else?!"
"Sure! Umm, where are you from?"
Philadelphia.
"Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps."
Really?
"Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm."
Yeah-yeah.
Where's Monica?
"Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there."
Why not?
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
"Well, I, I should go in there."
"No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now."
Why not?
Because you sent away the dog!
This is ridiculous.
"Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed."
"Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried."
"I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign."
"Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!"
"Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?"
"Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!"
"Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!"
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Yeah! Right!
"You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s just sign the papers. All right? What?"
Nothing.
"Okay, can we just sign please?"
Uh-hmm.
Congratulations.
"Yeah, baby!"
What are you doing?
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
No thanks. I’m 29.
"Oh my God, I gotta go to work!"
"Oh sweetie, when do you think you’re going to get off tonight?"
Oh I don’t know honey. It’s gonna be really late.
"Oh come on, not again."
Good evening officer.
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
"Ah no. I don’t, but it could not have been more than sixty."
You’re right. It was 37.
I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
That’s right.
Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night…
Oh my God!
Your license please.
You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream Officer…Pretty?
It’s Petty. I’ll be right back with your ticket.
You have a son!
I know. I know.
"Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?"
Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Could you guys help me?
"Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you."
It-it’s really heavy.
"I got it. So hi, I’m uh, I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler."
I-I am Kristen.
"Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime."
"I…I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over."
Ah.
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
"Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!"
Smooth.
"All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris."
"Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose."
Just flip!
"Ha, tails!"
Damnit!
Hey.
Hi. Mom. Dad.
"Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube."
"Judy, the kids.."
"Jack, that’s what they call the subway."
"Ohh, I thought that you...."
"Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!"
"Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?"
"That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams."
"Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie."
Hey Mon!
Hey!
"Mon, look who I ran into!"
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
"Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?"
"You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!"
"And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler."
Hey.
Oh yeah.
And that’s Phoebe over there!
Hi!
"Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we’ve seen each other?"
"1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon’s party. I played you one of my songs, y’know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual."
"Oh yeah. Right. So now, are—do you, do you still do music?"
"Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I’ll play you one of my other…"
"Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad."
"Well, let's just go in there and face them."
"Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy."
"I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning."
"Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready?"
Ah-haah! I win!!
What is that?
That's fire. Beats everything.
"Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?"
"Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played."
"Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time."
"Alright, okay."
It's locked.
Hey Ross! Doesn’t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
Yeah. Why?
Sting has a son that goes there too!
Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.
You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?
"Sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture."
What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
"No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?"
"Uh, I actually haven’t even met him."
"Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you."
"Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there."
"There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!"
Hi Chandler!
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
"Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy."
"Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting."
"It's uh, 27 dollars even."
"Oh, okay. Here you go."
"Hey, where's the chicken?"
"Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first."
Great. I'll see you later!
"Okay, bye!"
So you were saying?
I’m not quite sure.
"Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, ""Eight years."" And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are."
"Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love with you."
What?
I’m falling in love with you.
"Who are you talking too? Oh, you’re kidding! Oh, it’s a joke! It’s funny. It’s funny. I don’t get it. Oh. Okay. Umm… I-I…uh, wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?"
Does it really matter?
"Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here."
"Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. Okay, you gotta say something!"
"Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…"
But.
Joey.
"Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I think I’m gonna go."
"No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!"
"Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause then you’re gonna make me do that. Oh, here we go!"
Can I?
Sure!
Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…
"Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can’t. Okay? Ever!"
I’m so sorry.
"Oh no-no Rach, please, don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry. Y’know I was only kidding you."
"Yeah, that was a real good one."
Joe. How's it going?
Good. Hey.
Hi.
"Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?"
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
"Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni."
"Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller."
"So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?"
"Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class."
"Oh, forget about it. She rocks!"
Where do I know you from?
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
"No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?"
"Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor."
That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
"See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting."
"Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie."
"Yeah, that was real."
"He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?"
Brooklyn Heights.
Cleveland.
"How, how did that happen?"
Oh my god.
What?
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
"Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi."
What the hell is this?
Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
"Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?"
"Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip."
"You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?"
"Umm, I'm still here."
"You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us."
What?!
"Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights."
"Okay, umm, you're a loon."
"Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?"
I don't know.
Why not?
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
"One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even."
"Okay, great!  Bye. So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?"
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
"I miss Rachel. No, my parents."
"Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!"
"Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! I was thinking we would eat around four."
Why can’t I tell them that we live together?
Because they don’t know we’re dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Why haven’t you told them?!
"Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t."
Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I’ll see you then.
"I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night."
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
"That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there."
"I can’t believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York."
"No, it’s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe."
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
"No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross."
"Hey, mate."
How are ya man?
"Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!"
What the hell are you doing?
"Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble."
"Well, we're not."
But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
We don't have a code word.
"We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger."
"I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night."
"I know, I want that too, but is that going to make it too hard?"
"It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped."
"Kiss him, you fool!!"
What?
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
"Oh, I missed you so much!"
I knew you'd be here!
"Oh, crap!"
Who is this?
My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
"Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!"
"Well, you are not doing a very good job!"
Excuse me?
What's with the kissing?
"Hey, at least I knew where my guy was."
"Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!"
You didn't hear the speech!
"I've heard the speech: ""if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... """
"Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!"
You're weak!
You're... weird!
Your pants are undone!
Oh!
Where did they go?
Damn it!
Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
And I blame you too.
Hi Pheebs.
Hi!
Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.
"That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today."
"Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours."
Oh yeah!
"Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…"
Oh that’s so sweet thanks.
"Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there."
Ohh.
"And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings. I’m just gonna grab a couple of these."
This stuff is great!
"Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue. Yeah…"
"Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made of honor."
You do? Why?
Because I think it means more to you.
"But Pheebs, y’know you earned it."
"Its fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14?"
"No, I was ten. I just developed early."
"All right, I…I have to ask."
What?
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
What?!
"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?"
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.
"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!"
"Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat."
"Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different."
How?
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
"What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!"
"Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica."
Keep going.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
I’d carry you around in my pocket.
I love you.
Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
"And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. Yes we were! Yes we were! Come here gorgeous. Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? But you've got... You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. Big baby butt! I like big butts. I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get...Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm...My anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon...  I'm a terrible father!"
"How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin’!"
"Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?"
"Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there."
What happened?
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
"Joey, why would you do that?"
Because they wanted me to audition!
You! An actor?! That’s madness!
"You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie."
Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
"No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!"
"Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us."
"Of course, I'd be honored!"
Thanks!
Thank you!
"Ah, look who’s back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?"
"Well, I’m staying with you guys!"
What?
We’re gonna be roomies! Come on!
"…in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the nominees are: John Wheeler from General Hospital, Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless, Dunkin Harrington from Passions , and Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives. And the Soapie goes to……Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless!"
What the?!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…
I don’t think you did a very thorough job!
"I dropped him off at Carol’s. Anyway, it turns out that I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though."
Oh no! Why not?
Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.
How come?!
"Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims."
Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
"Phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends."
"Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!"
Playpen?! Ben’s seven!
Your kid is seven?! He’s really small. Please! Please get the tickets!
"Look I’m sorry Pheebs, I can’t do it."
Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
What?
Rosssss can!
"Look Phoebe, I’m sorry it’s just…"
Rossss can!
"Phoebe, I…"
Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
"No, although now that's what I'm thinking."
"All right, so what were you thinking?"
"Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?"
Ohh! No.
Why not?
"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak."
No you're not.
"I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings."
"Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother."
Oh Drake.
"Hard day huh? First the medical award, this."
Some guys are just lucky I guess.
"Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat."
"Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?"
"No, no, they only said you."
"Oh, ok. Alright."
I love you Drake.
"Yeah, whatever. Oh no."
"Drake, look out."
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Mark's a genius!
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
"Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you."
What am I going to do?
"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits."
I don't know you guys.
"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'"
"And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'"
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
"Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?"
Yeah.
Sure. Yeah.
"So, who’s the guy?"
"Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners."
"Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?"
"Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am."
"Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?"
"Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?"
"Yeah, I’d really like to."
"Okay, hopefully this time mom won’t boo you."
"Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it’s always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I’m going to make them cry."
And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
"No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, ""God, your brother."" Know what they’ll say this year? ""God, you"""
"Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I’m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue."
Really you can do that?
Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I can’t do it with you guys watching me!
"Well, umm, why don’t you give him a call?"
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
"Oh, I’m sure."
"Chip! Hi, it’s Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh."
"Oh, that’s right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that’s gotta be embarrassing!"
"Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play."
Really? Wh-what's wrong?
"I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!"
"Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry."
"... Ok, who is this?"
"I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a colleague."
"Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!"
"So, in conclusion, the lines all go up, so I’m happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn’t have done it without ya."
"Thank you, sir."
"Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident."
"Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard!  Well, what about you? You’re not feeling left out or anything are ya?"
"No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous."
"Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you?"
"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
"Now get on out of here, you!"
"Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me."
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
"It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?"
She's your partner.
Hi. I'm Monica.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Monana?
Yeah. It's Dutch.
You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
"Um, Pennsylvania Dutch."
"And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight..."
"...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying."
"Oh, this is so great."
"Yeah, it was."
All right then. Bye.
"Hello, people who do not live here."
Hi! Hello!
I gave you a key for emergencies!
We were out of Doritos.
"Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?"
"Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately."
"He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!"
Still?!
"Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything."
Oh my God!
You started that?!
What?! You heard that?!
Everyone at our school heard it!
Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
"Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault."
"Monica, how come you never told me this?!"
I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!
I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.
Oh!
"You didn't get the money, did you?"
"Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!"
"No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?"
Come on along and listen to...
"Okay, Widow!"
...the lullabye of...
"Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go."
All right. I'll get my bag.
Good.
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
"Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you."
"Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support."
"Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one."
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
"Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her."
Really.
"I tell you, I've never seen him this happy."
"So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?"
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
Oh Jack stop.
"C'mon, it's my birthday."
Did you see our bank statement? Could this be right?
I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
I'm not sure what they did...but I'm inclined to blame.
"I guess with you doing the internship, we're spending more than we're bringing in."
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
Oh...But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was...y'know...finding gold.
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month. And maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refridgerator for a change. You're a chef...what can you make out of baking soda and beer?
Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
No! We're not borrowing money.
Why not?
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was...well to always knock before going into the poolhouse...But the other thing was...never borrow money.
Wow! I had no idea you had this much pride.
That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
"Hey hon, could you help me get the plates down?"
"Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?"
"No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over."
"Honey, she keeps canceling on us. Take the hint."
What if something gets broken? They're so expensive!
What is the point of having them if we never use them?
"Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..."
I will explain it to her.
"Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the Queen."
"Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?"
"Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray."
Okay.
"Item J437-A, color: winterberry. Hi umm, listen come here, come in. I’m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I’m really sorry. It’s just that I…"
"Listen Ross, you don’t have to apologize. I understand why you were there."
You do?
"Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t. It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be."
Oh God you’re right.
"Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go. Can I? To remember you?"
No.
"All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's no call for writing ""Screw you, Mr. Bing!"" on the back of my chair! -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler."
Hey!
Hey.
Hey. Where've you been?
"I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham."
"You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
My kid's in a play right now.
"Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order."
"""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet""."
"Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!"
Now it feels like Christmas.
"I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
You can come to my house!
"Haha, no thanks!"
That was a nice pep-talk.
"Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
"So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?"
"Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional..."
"Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?"
"Yes! Yes, I did."
Then do Iceberg!
G-sharp.
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
"No, but you're questioning my method!"
"No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!"
Thank you.
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
"Your other student, was you!"
"Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!"
"Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!"
"Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!"
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
"What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson."
Who?
"Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt."
"Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?"
"Umm, no. No."
Yes you did! What was it?
"Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty."
Ohh that’s so sweet!
"Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all."
Dr. Geller!
Burt!
We are NOT signing those papers.
Why not?
It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
God works in mysterious ways.
You have gotta stop!
But she liked us.
She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
"Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor."
Your Veal Chop is $34.95!
"C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now."
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
I know..
"I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?"
"oh, honey.."
"Please.. please, we are so close."
"Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to."
"okay, right."
"So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us."
Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
You're Jewish.
Technicality!
"Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel."
"All right. Y'know what? We don’t have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us!  All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13."
Hit me!
"Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!"
I bet 20.
You're right!
"Hey, that is the…baby’s problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?"
"I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you."
"Well… Umm, I got TiVo."
What’s TiVo?
It’s slang for pregnant.
Phoebe!
Are you really pregnant?
"Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah."
Who is the father? Oh no! Please don’t tell me it’s her!
"No, it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross. Oh daddy, I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be a poppy!"
That’s true.
Yeah.
"Poppy. Oh, I’m gonna be a poppy. So when is the wedding?"
Who?
"The wedding! There’s going to be a wedding. Young lady, don’t you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard! Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!"
February 2nd!
"Okay! Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent."
Right! And when is that due?
First of the month.
And that’s every month?
"No, just the months you actually want to live here."
Ahhh.
"Okay, here is the phone bill."
Oh my God!!
"That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?"
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.
"It’s not charity, Joe…"
"No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on."
"Okay uh, here’s the electric bill."
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
"Uh, yeah."
"So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?"
"So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?"
"'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this."
"Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper."
"Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."
"Oh, you didn't have to do this."
"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get."
"Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer."
... finally...
Is that Ross?
"Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls."
Sounds like he's with someone.
"He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps."
"Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him."
Ooh... Dr. Geller!
"God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that."
"Oh my God, that's Charlie!"
She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
I'm not sure about this.
"Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business."
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
"Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend."
Ooh... I love Barbados!
Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
"I know, I'm her!"
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
What?
Get over here!
ooh...
Wow!
"Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!"
"Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!"
So you’re gonna... hit on her?
"No, no, no! My talents as an actor!"
Oh!
"You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!"
Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
"Hey, I think Emma might like it!"
Slides are almost ready.
"Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!"
"Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen."
Oh great!
Hello?
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
"O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking."
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!"
"Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me."
So?
"Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed."
"Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back."
"Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?"
I guess so.
Here you go. Thank you!
"Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?"
"Oh what, you-you want both of them?"
"Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!"
"Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it."
"Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!"
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
These are her earrings.
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Why not?
Because I lose her stuff!
"Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?"
"I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job."
"Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?"
How is that gonna happen?
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
I didn't say we were brothers.
"Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly."
"Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!"
Hello.
"Hello, Ross?"
"Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!"
"Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!"
"No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!"
Really? About what?
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
"I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do."
She's talking.
Dad?
I’m here!
Hey!
"Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work."
"Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house."
"Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling."
Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore.
"Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories…"
"Well, I don’t know what’s in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic."
I used to love to play restaurant.
"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater."
"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!"
God!
So beautiful.
"Oh, I know, isn't she?"
"No, I was talking about your bedding."
"All right. What's your news, Amy?"
Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
What? Oh my God! To who?
This guy! He has a killer apartment.
A-And??
A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
"No, what's he like?"
Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
Yeah.
It's his dad.
"Huh... wow, so he's gotta be..."
"Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there."
"Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like..."
Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
"Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?"
"Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep."
"Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!"
"You’re right, you’re right! I’m gonna do it!"
Ok.
I’m gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
"Ok, let’s keep talking."
"This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now."
"There’s the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?"
It’s Phoebe! Hi!
"Hi. Okay, will that be all?"
"Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?"
"Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, ""Excuse me, hello Miss,"" so now I’m here."
"No, no... how come you are working here?"
"Right, yeah, ’cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute."
Can we start over?
Yeah. Okay great. I’m gonna be over here.
"No, no, no!"
"All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like her sister."
I’m sayin’ I see a difference.
They’re twins!
I don’t care. Phoebe’s Phoebe. Ursula’s... hot!
Hi!
Hey.
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
"Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?"
"Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home."
Where's Ben?
He's sleeping.
"Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
"Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary."
"Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?"
It's not that kind of anniversary.
Ah! Oh.
Sooo!! Anyway...
"Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up."
"Oh God, Ross I am so sorry."
"Yeah, well."
"Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?"
"Oh yeah, I'd love that."
"Oh, great! Me too."
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
"Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save yourselves!"
"Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we’re gonna start with…"
"Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey."
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
"Yes, but for the last time."
"Okay fine, now Ross…"
"Oh, but-but I can’t do it."
Why not?
I’ve got Ben.
"Because, because I’ve got Ben."
"It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?"
He’s at a dinner party.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
"Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?"
"All right, sorry."
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
"We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!"
So it’s okay to date a student.
"Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou."
"Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents."
Yeah. What-what should I do?
"Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart."
Joey that is so sweet.
"Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together."
You’re really sticking with the shell necklace huh?
"You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!"
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Ross came in forth and cried!
Oh my God!
"Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!"
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
"Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made."
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!
It’s hard for some people!
Of course it is. Wow—whoa!
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Hey!!!
"Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of anymore for Ross!"
"Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!"
That was you!
"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
"I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out."
"I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday."
"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?"
Right here!
"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel…"
"Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!"
"It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t."
Okay.
Really?
"Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready…"
I know! I know.
Okay.
I’m gonna go tell Joey that that you’re back. I was really worried about you.
"Hey, did she buy it?"
Totally.
So did Heldi show you the place?
"Yeah, it’s beautiful."
I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
I know.
I want a baby.
"Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow."
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
"Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
"I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a canelope might hurt less."
"Oh, ehm... I'm... I'm rehearsing my lines. They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!"
Woow! I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
"Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey! D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?"
Are you serious?
"Yeah! Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again."
"Hey, that was an honest mistake!"
"Right! ""Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor? """
"Yeah, that was an awesome day!"
"Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today."
"It’s no big deal. Hey, y’know, you do what you gotta do. Right?"
"But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together."
Whatever.
"It’s like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?"
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
"Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal. Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it. Y’know, hey I understand. Y’know? Hey, when I’m in a play and you’re in the audience, I don’t talk to you, right? So it’s y’know, it’s uh, it’s cool. I’ll see you tomorrow."
"Yeah, when we’re in the audience he doesn’t talk to us, but he does wave."
Dad!!
"Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!"
Yay!
Yay!
"Hey, where you been?"
"I went back to Riff’s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries."
Score.
She is so hot!
"Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err..."
Pheebs?
Yeah?
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Why? Why would you wanna... do that?  Why?
"So that if we went out on a date, she’d be there."
"Well, I mean, I’m not my sister’s, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, it’s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we’ve grown apart, so, um... I don’t know, why not? Okay."
"Cool, thanks."
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
"Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?"
"Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!"
Hey!
"Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?"
"No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?"
"Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over."
"Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up."
Mmm hmm.
"Yeah, hey."
"Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover."
No.
Nice party.
"Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ..."
"Again, you're welcome."
"Look, I'll just give you this and go."
"Oh, you bought me a present! Why?"
"Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier."
"Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card. ""From Gavin"""
I really mean it.
"Awww, awww, it's beautiful."
"You don't mind? Well, what do you know, it fits!"
"See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?"
I'm not sure.
Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
I do have feelings for you.
You do?
"Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying."
"See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ..."
"Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!"
"Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father."
"I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?"
He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
": Hey Duck, is Chick here?"
Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.
"So you ah, ready for our last practice?"
": Yeah, but y’know, I think the reason we’re not getting that spin right is because my apartment’s too small."
"Look, you wanna use our place?"
": No, I ahh, had another idea."
Woah.
Foxy lady.
Where you goin'?
"Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades."
The Ice Capades?
"No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny."
"I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again."
"OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband."
…so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera!
"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time."
When did that happen to you?!
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!
"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging."
"Oh, this is so good you have got to try it."
"Oh, damn! I got it on my pants."
"Here, I'll get it."
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
"Oh, great!"
"Okay, bye! Oh my God!!"
That was unbelievable!
"Okay, see? I told you!"
"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach."
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
They're brother and sister!!!
"Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you said you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!"
"Hey, I can handle it! All right?"
"Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad."
That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.
"Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle."
"And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?"
Ross!  They’re gonna kill you!
"Well, why are you doing this anyway?"
"Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby."
You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
"Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!"
"I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know."
Hey!
Hey!
"Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?"
Sure.
"Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?"
"Oh-oh, yeah."
"All the time. In fact, I was undefeated."
"Uh, you weighted 200 pounds."
"Still, I was quick as a cat."
"Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway."
"Oh, you're kidding."
"Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?"
"We don't, we don't wrestle now."
"Yeah, not since I got too strong for you."
Too strong for me?
Yeah.
"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?"
Oh fine.
Ready? Wrestle!
"Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks."
"Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?"
How's it going?
Help me.
What?
I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
Really?
Please?
You really want me to come back?
More than I wanna get married.
"Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything."
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?"
Who?
Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
What's he doin' in my section?
I guess he doesn't know.
"Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?"
Mornin'.
"Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory."
"Your territory, huh?"
Yeah. Bijan for men?
No thanks.
Hombre?
Yeah. All right.
You were saying?
"Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?"
Did it turn into sand?
"Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine."
"No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot."
"Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn’t matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. Just try not to move your feet at all. There you go."
Hello.
Hi.
We’d like to close our accounts.
Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
No-no.
"No, we’d just like to close them."
"Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. Would you come over here please?"
"Hi, I’m Karen."
I wanna quit the bank!
"Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!"
Hey!
"Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it’s on the counter in your apartment."
Oh.
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Thank you.
"All right, let’s go! Bye, Pheebs!"
"Bye, Pheebs!"
"OK, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again."
"That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again."
You forbid me?
Um-hm.
"You know, I flew a long way to see my loving wife...is she here, by the way?"
"Don't joke with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now."
"Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?"
Yes.
"Then, I might as well do this. Not really sure what to do now."
"Knock, knock, knock."
"Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back."
"Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?"
"Ahh, yes."
"Hi Phoebe Abott, I’m your best friends daughter!"
You’re Erwin’s daughter?!
"No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?"
"Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?"
"Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess."
"Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There’s Frank."
"Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That’s my Dad, that’s Frank! Yeah! I’m sorry I’m getting all flingy."
"Take it easy--if you want, there’s cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!"
"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks."
Oh.
"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?"
"Oh no, I-I’m sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school."
"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything."
"Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact they had a nickname for the three of us."
"Oh, what? What was it?"
"The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way."
"Yeah, no, it was great."
"Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother."
"Oh hi, I’m, I’m Mona from her restaurant."
"Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name."
You think so? I’ve always kinda hated it.
"Aw come on, Mona Lisa?"
Uh-huh.
"Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world."
Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
"Linda Clickclocken. So what uh, what-what table are you at? Oh, uh me too."
Oh good. Now there’ll be someone there who likes my name.
"Yes there will. Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin Clickclocken."
"Oh, Joey! Sorry!"
No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!
Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
Really?
Yeah! Look!
I’ve never lived like this before.
I know.
Oh hello.
"Oh, it’s you. I see you everywhere. I’m Jim, Jim Nelson."
"Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately."
"We have. Maybe we’ll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o’clock?"
"Well, maybe we will. Oh!"
I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
"No, it's not!"
It's not? When was she born?
"Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break."
"Thank you, Pheebs!"
"Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch."
"What? You are way off, lady!"
"Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself."
"That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!"
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
"Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!"
We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
"Pete, can I get you something else?"
"Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out."
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
"Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you...."
"Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food."
"Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?"
"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know."
"I mean really, think about it."
"Ho-ho, I will."
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
"Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago."
"Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?"
"Well, I have a call in about that."
'Kay.
"Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book."
"Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!"
"Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils."
"Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?"
"Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren."
"Oh, honey, that's so sweet."
"Yeah, and what a great way to say, ""I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"""
It doesn't say that. Does it?
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
"Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great."
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
"Hey, you guys…"
Hey!
Is Monica here?
No.
"All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl."
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
"Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?"
Yeah!
Okay! Check it out!
What-what is it?!
What the hell is that?!!
"It's a, it's a cat!"
"That, is not a cat!"
Yes it is!
Why is it inside out?!
"Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!"
How much did you pay for that?
"Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal."
Yeah? How much?
A thousand bucks.
ON A CAT??!!!!
It's not a cat!
"I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced."
Which time?
"The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian."
I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way.
"I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical."
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
"And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure."
Sure I would!
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
"What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?"
"No, I just think Monica was that fat."
"Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there’s Carol again!"
"Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom."
"Calm down, I'm blow drying."
"Blow drying what, you have no hair."
What's goin' on?
"Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again ."
"Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now."
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
"Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue."
All yours.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Cut it out.
Mi-mi-mii.
I've never wanted you more.

Hi Joey.
Hey Pheebs!
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
"$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?"
"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed."
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
"No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster."
"A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks."
"Yeah, not the one I had my eye on."
"It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers… Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!"
"Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no!"
"Joey, Joey I am so sorry."
"I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?"
"Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair."
She’s not even cold yet!
"But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first."
That’s true.
"Oh good, you haven't left yet."
Where have you been?
I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
"Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy."
Oh man.
Promise to call me when you land.
Of course I will call you. I love you.
I love you too.
"Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here."
Bye Chandler.
Awww. Bye!
Bye honey.
What's the matter Joe?
I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
"Dude, you see right through me!!"
"Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!"
"Okay, bye-bye! Good trip!"
"Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, new job,  you. This is just something I have to do."
I know.
I love you so much.
I know that too.
"Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise."
Double promise? Call me when you land.
Can I talk now?
"Okay, bye."
Joey?
He had to board.
"Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It’s Phoebe!"
"Oh, yay…"
Great…
Hi!
"Hi, so what happened?"
"Well, Ross said my name."
"Yeah, I know, but I don’t think that means anything."
"Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then…"
"Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?"
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Who?
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
Wow!
"Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy."
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
"No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses."
"Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it."
"I did do it, I'm a professional."
Then what's the problem?
"See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother."
"Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing  Ooh."
Hey! Ready to go?
"Oh yeah, let me just finish this."
"Hey Ross, check this out!  Yeah, I can't do that!"
What are you doin'?
"Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to."
"Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless ."
It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
"Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident..."
Bet she'd sleep with you now...
No... I already e-mailed her.
"Let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "" You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!"
Hey!
Hey!
Hey sweetie!
WOW!
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
"I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?"
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
"Eh, you got a spray-on tan?"
Chandler gets pedicures!
"Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?"
Why...why?
"Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!"
"Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off."
"So, do you get colours or just French tips?"
There. Here's their card.
"Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... florist."
"Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, “Look how much money we've got!” Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it."
"Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose."
"Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing."
"Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy."
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
"Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!"
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
"Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?"
"Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!"
Good luck!
"Your name, please?"
Joey Tribbiani.
"Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study.  Uh, sir?"
Yes he did.
"All right, we’ll call you in a few minutes."
"Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!"
"Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin’?"
What?!
You’re coming on to the entire room! I’m Chandler.
I’m Marjorie.
Hi.
Hi.
You mind if I…
"No, please."
"So uh, what are you in for?"
I talk in my sleep.
"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep."
So why don’t you give me your number?
"So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?"
"Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my friends.’"
"Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass."
"Uh, I’m going to take off."
"All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!"
What is it?
It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
All right. ‘Candy and Cookie?’
"Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?"
So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
Books?
"All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!"
"Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang."
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
"Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no."
Dude! What is going on?!
I just…I have to find out how it went.
Why?
This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!
They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!
I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!
"Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?"
I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.
What do you mean?
"It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section."
That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
"Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?"
It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.
"Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel."
No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
"I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants."
"No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now."
"That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?"
Yeah.
"Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!"
We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
"No, I said fun!"
Hey!
Hey Pheebs.
"Oh, not anymore. I changed it today."
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hannigan."
"Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock."
That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Phoebe!
Uh! Princess Consuela.
You seriously changed your name to that?
Uh-huh!
"Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?"
"Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie."
The Waltham Residence.
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house.
"This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses oneself on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak."
"This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it’s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?"
"Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it’s not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye."
"No no no, I’ll be nice, I swear!!!   Could you just give me the number for where they are?"
"I’m afraid, I’m not at liberty to divulge that information."
"Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire."
Hangs up.
"Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass."
"Oh hey Rach, listen—Hi!"
Hi.
"Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin’ to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren…"
"No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste."
"No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she’s really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to give her some advice."
I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…
"Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!"
Really?! Oh my God! I’m successful!
"Okay, so will you meet with her?"
Yes! I’d love to! Have her come by the office.
"Great! Thanks! You’re gonna love her so much. And—Oh, she’s the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y’know the S.A.T’s?"
Yeah.
She took ‘em!
"Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!"
"All right, then massage me up right nice!"
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
"It's so good, isn't it?"
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Good-bye muscles!!
"I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know what it was!"
"Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her."
"Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth."
Hey you guys!
Hey! Happy birthday ...
"Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me."
"Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly. Molly, Chandler, Joey."
Hi.
Hi.
"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy."
"You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes."
"Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside."
"No, you stay, I'll do it."
"OK, thank you."
Nice to meet you guys.
"Yeah, you too."
"Oh, wow, Molly is just great!"
Yeah.
"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny."
What? You really think she's hot?
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
And Joey?
How do you think she's doing?
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
"Eh, I mean, I mean she's not unattractive but hot? I ...."
Thank you!
Now that Rachel's gone?
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
It's James Bond.
Sorry we're late.
"Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was."
"Dr. Burke, it, it's me."
"Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great."
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
"Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you.  So, how ya been?"
"I've been great, just great. How have you been?"
"Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt."
The head tilt?
"Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'"
I'm sorry.
"No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change."
"Oh, that's too bad."
I'll survive.
"Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful."
"Yeah, he's head of the department."
"All right—Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!"
What?
I'm having my first contraction!
Oh no.
"Ooh, it's not bad."
Okay.
"Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!"
Hey! You okay?
"Ooh, something hurts!"
"Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!"
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Hello.
"Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie."
"Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?"
That's what it sounded like.
All right…
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Excuse me ladies. I’m sorry?
"My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon."
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
"Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop."
"Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!"
"Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment."
"Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!"
"He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry."
"Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?"
His daughter was hot.
Gotcha.
She sent the chicken back again?!
She says it’s to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
OH…MY…GAWD!!!!
Lucky bastard! Janice.
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
I’m fine.
Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I’m blind!
Oh… Uh…
"So, who’s the lucky guy?"
"So, did you pick one yet?"
"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn."
"Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!"
"Y’know, you’re right. Thank you."
"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague."
Prague?
There’s sooo much you don’t know.
"Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?"
Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?
"No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict."
"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?"
"No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom."" He may think I’m sick."
"Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it."
"Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?"
Pretty much.
All right.
Hey Monica!
Hi!
"Hey man, you feeling any better?"
"Joey, we have something to tell you."
Oh my God! You’re pregnant!
"No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving out man."
"Wow! Well, uh… Hey! I’m really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later."
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
"Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job.  Like you’d believe that. This sucks!"
"Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!"
"Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you’re gonna be moving in with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm… Oh-oh he always, he always umm—Oh, who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever!"
"I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks. If you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be just nifty!"
"Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man."
Jarvis?
"Oh, you're back... this is my wife, Nancy."
Get Out!
Hi.
Hi...May I help you?
"Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?"
Okay...who are you?
"Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?"
"Oh, c'mon in."
Thanks.
"Hi, I'm Rachel."
Hi.
Bathroom's up there.
Great.
"Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya."
Excuse me.
Ahhhh.
"Uh, is your name Chandler?"
"Uh, yes, yes it is."
Chandler Bing?
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
"I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse."
"Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up."
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
"Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp."
"Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants."
"Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore."
"No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows."
"OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?"
"OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money."
"Oh that's me, I gotta go."
"Oh uh, o, OK."
"Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date."
"Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas."
Sir.
"Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?"
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
"I have a family, I'm gonna be here."
"Yeah Bing, what's that about?"
"It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday."
Rough numbers?
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
"Uh, if you say so sir."
"You know what? I can't even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can't believe how much I love her, I can't get enough of her, like right now I miss her I actually miss her."
You know that's? that's her.
"Oh god look at her sleeping, oh I love her so much, oh I think I'm gonna wake her up."
"Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby."
"Well I can do whatever I want, I made her, come on little girl, hi!"
I don't wanna say I told you so but she's kinda doing that for me.
Oh I'm sorry mummy's so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep shh shhh! Go back to sleep.
"And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?"
"Well, I'm- I'm showering."
"No, that was clenching."
"Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here."
"I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?"
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask…
"Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!"
"Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?"
"Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?"
"Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"
"Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."
Hey Phoebe!
Hi Pheebs!
Pheebs!
Fine!
"Phoebe, what's the matter?"
"Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
